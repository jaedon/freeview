DFB is a simple DirectFB based graphics benchmark tool. It measures the raw graphics performance
of the platform by running a series of tests that exercise operations that are commonly used within
the Netflix UI.

The operations tested by DFB are:

- Color fill
- Color fill with alpha blending
- Blit (image copy)
- Blit with alpha blending
- Stretch blit (scaling)
- Stretch blit with alpha blending
- Text rendering

Each test runs for ten seconds and then outputs the frames per second result to stdout.

## Running

- Copy the files 'benchmark', 'Netlix_Logo.png', and 'Arial Bold.ttf' to the target platform
- Execute dfb from the command line
