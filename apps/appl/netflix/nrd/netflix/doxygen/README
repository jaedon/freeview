The files in this directory are used by the top-level Makefile to generate
reference documentation for the NRD Platform SDK using Doxygen, and 
if installed dot (graphviz). 

On an Ubuntu system, you can install Doxygen and dot as follows: 
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz

To generate documents:

1) Run configure as described in the main README. 
2) From your build directory, run any of the following: 
    
    make documentation-dpi       /* useful for partner DPI implementers */
    make documentation-nbp       /* useful for UI framework integration */
    make documentation-api       /* intended for internal Netflix developers */
    make documentation-internal  /* intended for internal Netflix developers */
    make documentation-clean     /* cleans generated documentation */
