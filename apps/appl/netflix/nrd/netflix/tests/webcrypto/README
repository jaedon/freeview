Before compiling please change the following in TestWebCrypto.cpp
1. In getReeWebCrypto change the kpe and kph to appropriate values
	These should be pre-shared keys.

NOTE:
- Persist Keys test are not included because it needs NRDAPP to access file system.
- Diffie-Hellman tests are tested in Diffie-Hellman stress test.
- All the symmetric tests are tested REE vs TEE. Except for large buffer tests, which are tested only in TEE.
	- Encrypt - Decrypt
	- HmacSign - HmacVerify

Compile:
