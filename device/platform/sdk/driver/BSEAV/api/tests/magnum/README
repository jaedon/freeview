	#include "bsettop_board.h"
	bsettop_boot_board();
	bsettop_shutdown_board();
	
	/* The following are also accessible */
	#include "bsettop_os.h"
	#include "bsettop_core_event.h"

2. Base-level: Brings up board-level and most of porting interface.
	
	#include "bsettop_base.h"
	bsettop_boot();
	bsettop_shutdown();

3. Top-level: Brings up everything.

	#include "bsettop.h"
	bsettop_init(BSETTOP_VERSION);
