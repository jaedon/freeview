Settop API utils README

The utils directory contains a set of simple command line apps.

It should be noted that the Settop API does not maintain state
between application runs. It is a side-effect that on linux,
the kernel-mode driver maintains state. On other architectures, or
in linux user-mode, there is no state maintained between application
runs. The previous test_apps made use of this driver state.
