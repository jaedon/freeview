//    Description:
//
//		Cablemodem V2 code
//		
//    Wrapper for an STL basic_string to eliminate inline expansions.
//    The sole reason for doing this is to reduce code size.  Turns out that
//    savings can be considerable: ~85k for the pSOS build as of this
//    release.  Note that this object does not wrap all basic_string
//    methods, just the ones we need to build.  Since the whole point of
//    this is code savings, I intentionally left out all unused methods.
//    Any method that needs to be added later can be, you get the idea.
