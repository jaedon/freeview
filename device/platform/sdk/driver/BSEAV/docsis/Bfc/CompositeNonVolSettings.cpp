//  Filename:       CompositeNonVolSettings.cpp
//  Author:         David Pullen
//  Creation Date:  Nov 1, 2000
//
//****************************************************************************
//  Description:
//      This is a specialization of the NonVolSettings base class to handle
//      the usage pattern called "Compositing".  Its purpose is to store a list
//      of settings objects, and to iterate over that list when any of the
//      base class public methods are called.  The client doesn't need to know
//      that this is a composite class.
//
//      Generally, an application will derive a child from this class in order
//      to group all of the settings it needs together in a single object.
//
//      Note that it is perfectly legal, and may be useful, for a composite
//      class to be contained in another composite, but for this particular
//      class, it will usually be more desirable to have just a single composite
//      as the parent.
//
//      The composite class generally will not have any setting data of its own.
