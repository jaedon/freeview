/** \ingroup BfcNonVol
*
*      This is a specialization of the NonVolSettings base class to handle
*      the usage pattern called "Compositing".  Its purpose is to store a list
*      of settings objects, and to iterate over that list when any of the
*      base class public methods are called.  The client doesn't need to know
*      that this is a composite class.
*
*      Generally, an application will derive a child from this class in order
*      to group all of the settings it needs together in a single object.
*
*      Note that it is perfectly legal, and may be useful, for a composite
*      class to be contained in another composite, but for this particular
*      class, it will usually be more desirable to have just a single composite
*      as the parent.
*
*      The composite class generally will not have any setting data of its own.
