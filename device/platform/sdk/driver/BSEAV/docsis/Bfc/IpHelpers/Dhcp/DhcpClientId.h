/** \ingroup DhcpClientServer
*
*   This is a common helper class for the DHCP Client and Server; the client id
*   is a required parameter for many different objects, and there are two
*   approaches to representing it.  Most often, it is a MAC address, but it can
*   be any arbitrary array of octets.  There are other approaches that can be
*   added as needed.
*
*   Rather than duplicating the APIs to handle both MAC address and octet buffer
*   in the other DHCP objects, this class does this once, and then it is used
*   in all of the other APIs.
