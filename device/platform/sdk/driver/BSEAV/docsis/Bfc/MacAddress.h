/**
*      This is a utility class that encapsulates an Ethernet MAC address.  It
*      is really just an array of 6 bytes, but we do lots of stuff with them
*      (comparisons, reading from/writing to octet buffers, etc.).
*
*      This class has been highly optimized for the masking and comparison
*      operations that we tend to perform as a networking device.
*
*      The BcmMacAddress class below is the result of merging two similar
*      classes, BcmMacAddress and MacAddress, each of which represented a MAC
*      address.  Each class was widely used, so completely cleaning up the
*      unified class would have meant changing the many files that used
*      the classes.  Instead, the unified class has some mildly quirky 
*      appearance to minimize the number of file changes needed.  The
*      quirks are noted below.
