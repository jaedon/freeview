/** \ingroup BfcNonVol
*
*      This is the abstract base class for all kinds of hardware-specific
*      Non-Volatile Storage Devices.  There will be hardware-specific and
*      target-specific derived classes that handle the appropriate
*      functionality.
*
*      Note that the settings are independant of the device to which they are
*      being stored, allowing the same application settings to be used on
*      multiple target platforms and devices!
*
*      The derived class will generally be placed in the a BSP or other h/w
*      directory, since it is hardware/target-specific.
*
*      This class provides the common API, as well as some helper methods, for
*      all of the NonVol Devices.
*
*      All NonVolDevices will have the following 8-byte header layout:
*
\verbatim
        +--------+----------+--------------------+
        | Length | Checksum | {Settings data...} |
        +--------+----------+--------------------+
             4         4          Length - 8
\endverbatim
*
*      The Checksum and Length fields are calculated during Write(), and are
*      stored in network order.
*
*      The Length field tells how many bytes of header and app data are
*      contained.  This field must always come first, and will always be at
*      least 8.
