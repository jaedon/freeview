/** \ingroup BfcNonVol
*
*      This is the abstract base class for all kinds of application-specific
*      Non-Volatile settings objects.  An application will define its own
*      class derived from this one, giving it the values and ordering, as well
*      as methods for converting to/from a flat buffer.
*
*      Each NonVol Settings object has a split personality, containing both
*      Permanent and Dynamic settings.  The section that is being operated on
*      is specified as a parameter to most of the methods.  We went with this
*      approach rather than splitting it out to 2 objects because the settings
*      really are related, they are just stored in different locations so that
*      the permanent settings can be protected from write failures.
*
*      Note that the settings are independant of the device to which they are
*      being stored, allowing the same application settings to be used on
*      multiple target platforms and devices!
*
*      The derived class will generally be placed in the application directory,
*      since it is application-specific; if it is used in multiple apps, then
*      it may be appropriate to place it in a common directory.
*
*      This class provides the common API, as well as some helper methods, for
*      all of the settings objects, providing a common interface for all of the
*      possible types of Non-Volatile devices.
*
*      All NonVolSettings have the following 8-byte header layout:
*
\verbatim
        +--------+-----------+----------+----------+------------------------+
        | Length | Magic Num | VerMajor | VerMinor | {App settings data...} |
        +--------+-----------+----------+----------+------------------------+
             2         4           1          1                n
\endverbatim
*
*      The length is set by the base class after the derived class has written
*      all of its data.  On input, it is used bound the number of bytes that
*      are available for reading.  It includes all bytes, including the length
*      field itself, and will always be 8 or larger.
*
*      The magic and version numbers are set by the derived class in the
*      constructor, or are read from the device.  The Magic Number allows the
*      derived class to be sure that it was what wrote the settings (so that
*      it doesn't read in another object's settings).
*
*      The Checksum or other information is handled by the specific
*      NonVolDevice rather than by the settings.

/** \defgroup BfcNonVol BFC Non-Volatile Settings (i.e. NonVol)

This document describes NonVol Settings as implemented by the BFC Core framework,
and extended by numerous BFC applications and components.

<H2>Introduction</H2>

Communications devices often need to store information so that it persists across
power cycles.  Such information is usually called non-volatile settings.

Some of the information is set at manufacturing time:
  - MAC addresses
  - Certificates
  - Calibration data
  - Serial number

Other data may be initialized at manufacturing time, but can be changed at
runtime:
  - Enable/disable encryption
  - User name/password
  - Change the WiFi SSID
