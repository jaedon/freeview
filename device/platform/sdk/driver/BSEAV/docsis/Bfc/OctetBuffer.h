    /** \name BITS encoding accessors
    *
    * These methods allow clients to read and write the octet buffer as though
    * it were BITS encoded.  A BITS encoding is a rather backward SNMP concept
    * which has been adopted by other protocols (such as DOCSIS).
    * 
    * In a BITS encoding, the array of bytes is treated as a continuous
    * bitmask, where bit 0 is the MSB of the first byte, bit 7 is the LSB of
    * the first byte, bit 8 is the MSB of the second byte, etc.  For example:
    * 
    * +-----------------------+-----------------------+---------------
    * | 0| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|...
    * +-----------------------+-----------------------+---------------
    * |<-----  Byte 0   ----->|<-----  Byte 1   ----->|<-----  Byte 2 ...
    * 
    * The accessors related to BITS encodings do the byte/bit-swapping math
    * for you, so that you can simply say "Is bit 9 set?" or "Set bit 23".
    * Note that BITS encodings are variable length.  An empty BITS encoding
    * has length 0. 
    *  
    * When reading a bit beyond the end of the buffer (and/or valid bytes in the 
    * buffer), a value of 0 will be returned. 
    *  
    * When setting a bit beyond the end of the valid bytes used in the buffer 
    * (but still within the actual buffer), the bytes used will be increased and the
    * newly consumed bytes will be filled with 0.  For example, if the buffer 
    * size is 256 bytes, but it is empty, setting bit 8 to 1 will cause the buffer 
    * to have 2 bytes consumed, with the MSB of the 2nd byte set to 1. 
    *  
    * Attempts to set a bit beyond the end of the buffer will be rejected (the 
    * buffer is not automatically resized).  For example, if the buffer size is 2 
    * bytes, attempting to set bit 16 (or higher) will fail.  This is consistent 
    * with other methods that add data to the end of the buffer - the bytes used in 
    * the buffer can be increased, but you can't exceed the size of the buffer. 
    * 
    * Added for PR12948.
