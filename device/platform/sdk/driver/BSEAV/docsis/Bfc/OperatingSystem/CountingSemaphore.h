/** \ingroup OsWrappers
*
*   This is the base class for all types of operating system counting
*   semaphores.
*
*   A counting semaphore can be used for many different purposes; it has
*   characteristics of both events and mutexes.  It can act as a type of
*   event, where it keeps track of the number of times the event occurred;
*   it can be used to control access to a set of shared resources, where
*   the semaphore allows a lock for each of N resources, but no more.
*
*   Counting semaphores have the most options of all the wrapper objects.
*   They can be pre-set with a count; they can have a maximum count or can
*   be unbounded; and they can have a BcmEvent instance (if associated with
*   a BcmThread) or can be created without one (if associated with a data
*   object).
*
*   Like mutex semaphores, counting semaphores can be created both by
*   BcmOperatingSystem and BcmOperatingSystemFactory; this allows data
*   objects (who probably don't have access to the BcmOperatingSystem
*   instance of a thread) to create one for their own use.
*
*   Note, however, that a counting semaphore can only be used in conjunction
*   with a BcmEventSet if it is created by BcmOperatingSystem.
*   BcmOperatingSystemFactory creates the semaphore outside of the context
*   of a thread, so there is no BcmEvent associated with it.  You can still
*   wait on it by calling Get() with the appropriate timeout parameters,
*   you just can't add it to an event set.
