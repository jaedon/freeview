/** \ingroup OsWrappers
*
*   This is the abstract base class for event sets; an event set is a
*   container class that allows individual sources of events (like BcmEvent,
*   BcmTimer, and BcmMessageQueue) to be grouped together an operated on
*   simultaneously.  This is necessary because BcmEvent, BcmTimer, and
*   others only allow you to operate on that particular instance.  The
*   primary use of this class is to allow a thread to wait for one or more
*   of a set of events to occur.  The API is similar to the BcmEvent API,
*   but with some additions to handle multiple events.
*
*   Note that, unlike BcmEvent and BcmMessageQueue, this class is NOT meant
*   to be used as an interface between multiple threads.  It is simply a
*   container class that helps a thread manage its set of events.
*
*   In all of the methods of this class where there is a BcmEvent parameter,
*   you can substitute a BcmTimer, BcmMessageQueue, or any other class that
*   provides an explicit type conversion to BcmEvent.
*
*   Any class that has an associated BcmEvent (such as BcmTimer and
*   BcmMessageQueue) can be added to the event set.  For example, this
*   allows a thread to wait for an event to be sent, a message to be
*   received, or a timer to expire, which ever comes first.  A thread can
*   also wait for a combination of events before returning, such as a
*   received message and a timer expiration.
*
*   Note that all of the events stored here must be created/owned by the
*   thread that created/owns the event set.  This is because the events
*   are only valid in the context of the thread that created them.
