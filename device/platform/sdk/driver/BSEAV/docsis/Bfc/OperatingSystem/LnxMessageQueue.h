//  Description:
//      This is the Linux implementation of the Message Queue wrapper class.
//
//		In the interests of time, I will implement this using the same method
//		as the vxWorks implementation.  We will go back later and see if the 
//		Linux Message Queue is appropriate.  One possible problem is that the
//		Linux Message Queue is designed for interprocess communication.
//      So I am implementing this with an STL deque, a mutex to protect
//      against access by multiple threads, and an event to allow the queue to
//      be waited on.
//		One last thing... I/ve not been able to test the time-out functionality
//		using the LnxEvent class yet.  MDR

class BcmLnxMessageQueue : public BcmMessageQueue
{
public:

    // Default Constructor.  Creates a QNX message queue and sets up other
    // needed members.
    //
    // Parameters:
    //      pName - the text name that is to be given to the object, for
    //              debugging purposes.
    //
    // Returns:  N/A

    BcmLnxMessageQueue(const char *pName = NULL);

    // Destructor.  Frees up any memory/objects allocated, cleans up internal
    // state.
    //
    // Warning about possible memory leaks:
    //
    //      If the message queue has messages in it, then any memory associated
    //      with that data will not be freed.  This is because the message queue
    //      has no way to know whether the data is just a number, is a pointer
    //      to a buffer, or is a pointer to an object (whose destructor needs
    //      to be called).
    //
    // Parameters:  N/A
    //
    // Returns:  N/A
    //
    virtual ~BcmLnxMessageQueue();

    // This is the method that a thread will call when it wants to send a
    // message to the queue.  The message is appended to the end of the queue.
    // The structure, format, and contents of the message are defined by the
    // threads that use it.
    //
    // The first parameter is a message code that is agreed upon by the sender
    // and receiver.  These will generally be abstracted as enums that the
    // producers and consumers all have access to.
    //
    // The second parameter is a generic pointer who's type should be inferred
    // from the message code.  It can be used to hold any numerical value, or
    // it can be a pointer to an object or struct who's memory is being passed
    // from one thread to another.  Of course, if pointers to memory or objects
    // are being passed, then the producer and consumer must agree on whether
    // or not it needs to be freed/destroyed, and which thread must do it.
    //
    // Parameters:
    //      messageCode - the code that identifies the message being sent.
    //      pMessage - a generic pointer to be used for sending data.  This can
    //                 optionally be omitted if it is not necessary (e.g. if the
    //                 messageCode alone conveys enough information).
    //
    // Returns:
    //      true if successful.
    //      false if there was a problem (OS-specific).  This generally means
    //          that the message was not send, and the data needs to be dealt
    //          with by the called (freeing memory, etc.).
    //
    bool Send(unsigned int messageCode, void *pMessage = NULL);

    // This method is similar to Send(), except that it prepends the message to
    // the front of the queue, rather than appending it to the end.  All of the
    // same parameters apply.
    //
    // Parameters:
    //      messageCode - the code that identifies the message being sent.
    //      pMessage - a generic pointer to be used for sending data.  This can
    //                 optionally be omitted if it is not necessary (e.g. if the
    //                 messageCode alone conveys enough information).
    //
    // Returns:
    //      true if successful.
    //      false if there was a problem (OS-specific).  This generally means
    //          that the message was not send, and the data needs to be dealt
    //          with by the called (freeing memory, etc.).
    //
    bool SendUrgent(unsigned int messageCode, void *pMessage = NULL);

    // This is the method that a thread will call when it wants to try to
    // receive a message from the queue.  If a message is waiting, then it will
    // read the one from the front of the queue and return immediately.
    //
    // If one is not available, then the thread can optionally return
    // immediately (with an appropriate return code), or it can choose to wait
    // for a message to be sent.  The wait can either time out after a specified
    // number of milliseconds, or can wait indefinitely.
    //
    // By default, the timeout parameters are set such that the caller will wait
    // forever for a message to be sent.
    //
    // Parameters:
    //      messageCode - reference to a variable into which the message's
    //                    message code should be placed.
    //      pMessage - reference to a data pointer into which the data portion
    //                 of the message should be placed.  This must be type-casted
    //                 and interprited based on the messageCode.
    //      mode - the wait mode (forever or timeout).
    //      timeoutMs - the number of milliseconds to wait for a message to be
    //                  sent; only used if mode is set to timeout.
    //
    // Returns:
    //      true if the message was read.
    //      false if the message wasn't read (timed out waiting, or some other
    //          OS-specific problem occurred).

    // message from the queue.  Also, it does not allow the caller to wait for
    // a message to be queued.

    // Parameters:
    //      messageCode - reference to a variable into which the message's
    //                    message code should be placed.
    //      pMessage - reference to a data pointer into which the data portion
