/** \ingroup OsWrappers
*
*   This is the abstract base class (and wrapper) for operating system
*   message queues.
*
*   A message queue is an OS component that allows one or more threads to
*   send messages to another thread.  The messages contain information not
*   available from a BcmEvent or a BcmCountingSemaphore; they both indicate
*   that something happened (the semaphore also indicates the number of
*   times it happened), but they don't indicate what happens, and can't
*   carry any additional data.  A message consists of a message code, which
*   is generally one of a set of enum values that indicates the event or
*   command, and an optional data element, who's type should be inferred
*   from the message code.  The sender and receiver threads must agree on
*   the message codes and the format of the message data.
*
*   This message queue implementation is thread-safe, meaning that it
*   provides access and contention control against being modified by
*   multiple threads at the same time.  Other types of queues (such as STL
*   and other home-brew objects/structures) may be more efficient, but must
*   provide their own contention control mechanisms (mutexes).
*
*   Note that a message queue generally operates as a FIFO queue, though it
*   does provide a method to allow messages to be sent at the front of the
*   queue.
*
*   Message queues provide methods to allow a "producer" thread to send a
*   message (placing it either at the back or front of the queue); they
*   also allow the "consumer" thread, which created the queue, to wait for
*   a message to be sent, and to read the message, optionally leaving it in
*   the queue.
*
*   There can be multiple producers for a single message queue, and if
*   controlled carefully, there can even be multiple consumers.  Note,
*   however, that if there are multiple consumers, then it may only be
*   possible for one of them to use the queue in the context of a
*   BcmEventSet.
*
*   Because message queues have a BcmEvent associated with them, they can
*   be added to a BcmEventSet.
