/** \ingroup OsWrappers
*
*   This is the base class for all types of operating system mutual
*   exclusion semaphores.
*
*   This class is used to prevent multiple threads from accessing shared
*   data at the same time.  When one thread wants to read or write the
*   shared data, it tries to lock the mutex.  If the mutex is already
*   locked by another thread, then the thread must wait for it to be
*   unlocked before performing its operations.  Alternatively, it can time
*   out and give up on trying to access the data.
*
*   Note that, rather than making the threads explicitly lock the mutex,
*   the shared data object itself should contain and handle it on behalf of
*   the calling threads.  This way, the mutex is guaranteed to be enforced
*   and handled uniformly, and it only needs to be done in one place (the
*   data object), rather than in each thread that accesses the data.
*
*   This is one of the few OS components that doesn't have an associated
*   event, and that can't be added to a BcmEventSet.  It is used for
*   processing data, and either the thread gets it, or it doesn't.  The
*   thread can't request the lock and check for it later (this would block
*   other threads).
*
*   Mutex Semaphores can be created both by BcmOperatingSystem and
*   BcmOperatingSystemFactory; this allows data objects (who probably don't
*   have access to the BcmOperatingSystem instance of a thread) to create a
*   mutex for their own use.

// Here is a simple object to manage a mutex semaphore.  All it does is lock
// the mutex in the constructor and unlock it in the destructor.  The point
// of this is so we can create an instance of one of these objects on the stack 
// at the start of a function or method, and it will lock the mutex at that 
// time.  Then when we return from the function or method the object goes out
// of scope and is deleted, thus unlocking the mutex.  This avoids the risk of
// returning without unlocking the mutex (coding error), as well as being more 
// convenient to use since you don't have to call unlock before returning.
// Like so:
//
// int MyClass::MyMethod ()
// {
//   BcmMutexSemaphoreAutoLock Lock(fpMyMutex);
//
//   if (something)
//     return 1;
//   
//   else
//     return 2;
//
//   return 0;
// }
//
// The Lock object here will lock the mutex at the beginning and unlock it
// whenever we return.  Thus eliminating the risk of the common coding error
// where we lock a mutex then return without unlocking, thus producing a
// deadlock.  Also makes for cleaner code than the following:
//
// int MyClass::MyMethod ()
// {
//   if (fpMyMutex)
//     fpMyMutex->Lock();
//
//   if (something)
//   {
//     if (fpMyMutex)
//       fpMyMutex->Unlock();
//
//     return 1;
//   }
//   
//   else
//   {
//     if (fpMyMutex)
//       fpMyMutex->Unlock();
//
//     return 2;
//   }
//
//   if (fpMyMutex)
//     fpMyMutex->Unlock();
//
//   return 0;
// }
