// In most cases, a counting semaphore is associated with a particular

// This method creates an OS-specific counting semaphore that isn't
// associated with a particular thread.  Unlike counting semaphores that are
// created by BcmOperatingSystem, this semaphore does not have an associated
// BcmEvent.
//
// The semaphore that is returned is owned by (and must be deleted by) the
// caller when it is no longer needed.
//
// Parameters:
//      isBounded - set this to true if you want the semaphore to have
//                  a maximum count beyond which it cannot be incremented.
//                  Set it to false if you don't want a maximum count.
//      maxCount - the max count to be used, if isBounded is true.  This
//                 is ignored if isBounded is false.
//      initialCount - the count that the semaphore should start off with.
//      pName - the text name that is to be given to the object, for
//              debugging purposes.
