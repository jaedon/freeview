/**   \ingroup OsWrappers
*
*     This class is responsible for creating the correct type of
*     BcmOperatingSystem, based on compiler or other environment settings.
*
*     It can also be used to create reentrancy protection objects (like
*     BcmMutexSemaphore and BcmCountingSemaphore) without having to do so in
*     the context of the BcmThread; this is important in cases where a data
*     object will be accessed by multiple threads at the same time.  The data
*     object needs to be able to create a BcmMutexSemaphore that it will lock
*     and unlock whenever one of it's methods is called.
*
*     This class can also be used to cause the current thread to sleep,
*     yielding the processor to other threads.  Again, this is useful for
*     non-BcmThread objects; for example, a h/w interface object might need to
*     write a value to a register, then wait a while before reading another
*     register.
*
*     This class just has static methods; you don't need to create an
*     instance of this class to use it.
