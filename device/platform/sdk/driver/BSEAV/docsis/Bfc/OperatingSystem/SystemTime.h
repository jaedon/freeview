*   \file SystemTime.h
*
*   This file provides an OS-agnostic way to retrieve the current system
*   time (in milliseconds) as an unsigned long value.  There is also a
*   function to query the timebase of the system, which tells you the
*   accuracy of time values (e.g. 1ms, 10ms, etc.).
*
*   There is a new API that allows you to set the system time.  There is
*   always some OS-specific code involved in this (no C runtime support,
*   unlike getting the time of day).
*/

/// This function returns the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since
/// the system started.  It can be used as a snapshot of the system clock for
/// calculating the number of milliseconds that have elapsed.
///
/// Of course, the accuracy of this value depends on the system timebase, which
/// can be read via the SystemTimebaseMS() function.
///
/// Note that the counter can wrap around to 0.
///

///      The system millisecond counter.

/// This function allows a client to query the fundamental time base of this

/// is less than this, then it can either be truncated to 0 or ceiling'ed up
/// to this value.
