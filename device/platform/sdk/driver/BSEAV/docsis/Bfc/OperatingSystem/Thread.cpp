//  Description:
//      This is the base class from which all application threads are derived.
//      It handles most of the guts of creating and starting a new thread in an
//      OS-agnostic way, and provides common storage and functionality required
//      by all threads.
//
//      A thread is a client of the operating system components, but is agnostic
//      with respect to any particular OS.  As a result, there are no OS-specific
//      derived classes of BcmThread; there are only application-specific derived
//      classes.
//
//      Threads maintain their independence from any particular OS by only making
//      use of the abstract base classes of objects like BcmEvent, BcmTimer, etc.
