/** \ingroup OsWrappers
*
*   This is the base class from which all application threads are derived.
*   It handles most of the guts of creating and starting a new thread in an
*   OS-agnostic way, and provides common storage and functionality required
*   by all threads.
*
*   A thread (or task, as it is called in some operating systems) is the
*   basic unit of execution in the system.  All systems have at least one
*   thread, even if it's just the OS startup thread.  If a system is
*   sufficiently complex, then it may be desirable to subdivide it into a
*   number of separate threads that run independently (or that coordinate
*   with each other).  In this case, the application's root thread may just
*   create and start all of the other threads, and then suspend itself.
*
*   Note that threads are not OS-specific; they are application-specific,
*   which allows them to be portable and OS-agnostic.  As a result, there
*   are no OS-specific derived classes here like there are for the other
*   OS Wrapper classes.  The OS functions that control thread attributes
*   and state are delegated to another class (BcmOperatingSystem), which
*   does have OS-specific subclasses.
*
*   Threads maintain their independence from any particular OS by only
*   making use of the abstract base classes of objects like BcmEvent, 
*   BcmTimer, etc.
