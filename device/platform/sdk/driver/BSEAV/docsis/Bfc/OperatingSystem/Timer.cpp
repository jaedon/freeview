//  Description:
//      This is the abstract base class for operating system timers.  A timer
//      causes the OS to send an event (BcmEvent) to the thread after the
//      specified timeout interval has expired; thus BcmTimer has-a BcmEvent.
//
//      NOTE:  For some operating systems, a timer must be started by the thread
//             that expects to be notified.  Thus, when a thread creates a
//             timer, it must ensure that the timer will not be used by any
//             other thread.

// Default Constructor.  Sets everything to a quiescent state; note that
// the event to trigger is not created here - it must be created by the
// derived class.
//
// Parameters:
//      pName - the text name that is to be given to the object, for
//              debugging purposes.
//
// Returns:  N/A
//
BcmTimer::BcmTimer(const char *pName) :
    fMessageLogSettings("BcmTimer")
{
    // Call the helper method to create my object name.
    pfName = BcmOperatingSystem::GenerateName(pName, "Timer");
    
    // Set my instance name.
    fMessageLogSettings.SetInstanceName(pfName);

    fMessageLogSettings.Register();

    // Defer creation of the event to the derived class - they know what type
    // of event to create (and how to create it).
    pfEventToTrigger = NULL;

    // Set the rest of these to good default values.
    fHasBeenStarted = false;
    fIsRunning = false;
    fLastTimeoutMS = 0;
    fLastTimerMode = kOnce;
}


// Destructor.  Frees up any memory/objects allocated, cleans up internal
// state.  The most-derived class must call Stop() in order to ensure that
// the timer isn't running.
//
// pfEventToTrigger is deleted here.
//
// Parameters:  N/A
//
// Returns:  N/A
//
BcmTimer::~BcmTimer()
{
    fMessageLogSettings.Deregister();

    // Assume that the timer is stopped by now.  Delete the event object.

}


// Stops the timer and restarts it with the timeout value and mode that
// were sent in on the last call to Start().  If Start() has not been
// called, then the timer is not restarted.
//
// This is useful because it eliminates extra calls to the object, and you
// don't have to know what the previous values were in order to restart it.
//
// Parameters:  None.
//
// Returns:
//      true if the timer was restarted successfully.
//      false if the timer was not restarted (Start() has not bee called
//          previously, or there was a problem stopping and/or starting it).
//

    // before calling Start (the derived class will do so if necessary).
    return Start(fLastTimeoutMS, fLastTimerMode);
}


// Causes the calling thread to be blocked until the timer expires.  If the
// timer was not started, then it returns false immediately.
//
// Parameters:  None.
//
// Returns:
//      true if the timer expired.
//      false if the timer was not started.
//
bool BcmTimer::Wait(void)

    // event time out on the wait, because the timer will generate the timeout.
