/** \ingroup OsWrappers
*
*     Manages multiplexing of timers into a single physical timer.  
*     It keeps a list of TimerMuxACTs (asynchronous completion tokens) 
*     corresponding to active timers.  When something wants to start 
*     it's timer, it creates a TimerMuxACT and adds calls Start().
*     To stop the timer before it is expired, call Stop().
*     When the timer expires the ACTs HandleEvent() method will be 
*     invoked.  It is up to you to specialize the ACT for your application.
*     The use of the ACT makes this a general purpose tool that can be used 
*     in various applications, even allowing the same timer to be 
*     multiplexed for various applications at the same time.
