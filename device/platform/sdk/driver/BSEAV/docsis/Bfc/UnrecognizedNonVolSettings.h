/** \ingroup BfcNonVol
*
*      This is a specialization of the base class whose sole purpose is to
*      store the group settings data that is not recognized by other known
*      settings objects.  This allows us to preserve groups of data that were
*      written by other applications, so that their settings will still be
*      there when they run again.
