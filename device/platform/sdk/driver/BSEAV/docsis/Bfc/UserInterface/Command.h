//****************************************************************************
//  Description:
//      This class is the abstraction of a user command that is added to a
//      BcmCommandTable.  It groups all of the command settings, and provides
//      some helpers for manipulating things.
//
//      NOTE:  All of the string pointers in the class MUST be static strings
//             that will not change or be deleted, etc., because only the string
//             pointers are copied and stored!
//
//      Good Example 1:  This string is static/constant in the program, and will
//                       never leave any scope.  This is the preferred way.
//
//          myCommand.pfCommandName = "help";
//
//      Good Example 2:  This string is stored at file scope and thus is always
//                       valid.  Note, however, that it must not be changed
//                       after being stored.
//
//          static char gName[80];
//
//          void MyFunc(void)
//          {
//              sprintf(gName, "help");
//
//              myCommand.pfCommandName = gName;
//          }
//
//      Bad Example 1:  This string is allocated on the stack, and becomes
//                      invalid once the function exits.
//
//          void MyFunc(void)
//          {
//              char name[80];
//              sprintf(name, "help");
//
//              myCommand.pfCommandName = name;
//          }
//
//      Bad Example 2:  This string continues to exist because it is allocated
//                      on the heap, but it will never be deleted, thus causing
//                      a memory leak.
//
//          void MyFunc(void)
//          {
//              char *pName = new char[80];
//              sprintf(pName, "help");
//
//              myCommand.pfCommandName = pName;
//          }

// DPullen - Aug 14, 2002 - remove the old-style command stuff for slim
// images as part of a code shrink effort.  This should be done for non-slim
// images as well, but there are still a few command tables that use the old
// stuff, and I don't have the time or patience to convert them over and
// test all of the commands to ensure that I haven't broken anything.

// This is the prototype for the functions that will be called when the user
// types a valid command.  It must be a "C" style function, or a static
// class method.
//
// E.g.
//      void MyCmdHandler(void *pInstanceValue, unsigned int commandId, 
//                        const char *pParameters);
//
// Note that pInstanceValue can be NULL if there are no instances registered
// with the command table.
//
// Parameters:
//      pInstanceValue - the instance value to which the command should be
//                       applied.  Instances must be registered with the
//                       command table in order for them to receive the
//                       command.
//      commandId - the id of the command that was entered (from the
//                  Command structure).
//      pParameters - the string containing any parameters that were entered
//                    along with the command.  You must not modify this
//                    string (e.g. with strtok) to parse it, and you must
//                    not free it.
//
// Returns:  Nothing.
