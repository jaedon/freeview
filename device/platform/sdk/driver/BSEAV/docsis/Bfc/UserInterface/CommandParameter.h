/** \ingroup BfcConsole
*
*      This is the abstract base class for all types of command parameters.
*      Command parameters know how to print themselves to an ostream, and can
*      parse themselves from a string.
*
*      A console command can have 0 or more parameters, each of which can be
*      optional, and may have restrictions as to the type or range of the
*      value.  The actual data type of the value is handled by the derived
*      class.
*
*      \note  All of the string pointers in the class MUST be static strings
*             that will not change or be deleted, etc., because only the string
*             pointers are stored!
