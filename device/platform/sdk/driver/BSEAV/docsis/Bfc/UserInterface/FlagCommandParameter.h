/** \ingroup BfcConsole
*
*      This is the derived class for flag parameters.  A flag parameter
*      consists of a flag separator (usually '-'), a flag character, and 0 or
*      1 flag value parameters, which can be of any type.  Examples of this
*      are:
* \verbatim
    -a
    -s 1
    -n5
    -I 192.168.190.1
    -2
* \endverbatim
*
*      \note  Be careful to avoid confusion with the integer -2; avoid using
*             numbers as the flag character, even though it is allowed.
*
*      Currently the flag character is limited to a single character, and the
*      separator is always the '-' character.  The flag character is case
*      sensitive ('n' is not the same as 'N').
*
*      You can configure the flag and its value paramter such that the flag
*      is optional, but if present, then the value must be present, or you can
*      make the flag required and the value optional, etc.
*
*      \note  All of the string pointers in the class MUST be static strings
*             that will not change or be deleted, etc., because only the string
*             pointers are stored!
