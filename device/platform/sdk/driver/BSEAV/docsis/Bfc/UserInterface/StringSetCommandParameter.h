/** \ingroup BfcConsole
*
*      This is the derived class for string parameters which have a limited
*      set of values.  An example of this is a string parameter that can take
*      a value of "phs", "flow" and "cls", but nothing else.  It handles
*      parsing a string and making sure that it matches one of the values
*      specified.  It does not support using " chars to allow spaces or NULL
*      to mean a 0-length string.  It turns the string entered by the user into
*      a 0-based index, kind of like an enum.
*
*      The parser will allow the user to enter a partial string to match a
*      token; e.g. if the token string is "phs|flow|cls", then "phs" "ph" and
*      "p" will all match token 0.  However, "PHS" will not match, because the
*      matching is case-sensitive.
*
*      This implies that you must be careful in the order of the tokens.  If
*      the token string is "phs|flow|cls|flag", then "fl" will always match
*      token 1, and never token 3.
*
*      Note that the token string must not have spaces in it (because we won't
*      parse across a space in the input string).
*
*      \note  All of the string pointers in the class MUST be static strings
*             that will not change or be deleted, etc., because only the string
*             pointers are stored!
