/// This helper function converts an abstract bitmask (of up to 32 bits) into
/// a string of names, where each name corresponds to a bit in the mask.  It
/// starts iterating at bit 31, and continues until it has checked through bit 0
/// or has filled the output string.
///
/// The bitmask is passed in by the user, and can be any size up to 32 bits
/// (smaller sizes will be converted up to 32 bits, padded with 0's so that they
/// will be skipped).
///
/// The array of bit names must be specified, and must not be NULL.  It is
/// assumed that pBitNames[0] corresponds to bit 0, and so on.  If there are
/// gaps in the bits (reserved, etc.), then the pBitNames index corresponding
/// to that index can be NULL.  Also, you don't have to specify unused MSB names,
/// e.g. if only the 3 LSBs are used, then pBitNames can have only 3 entries.
///
/// If a bit in the mask is set, and there is no corresponding string in the bit
/// names array, then the string {Unknown} will be used.
///
/// The separator string that is specified will be used in between each name.
///
/// If the bitmask is 0 (no bits set), then the string {None} will be stored.
///
/// \param
///      bitmask - the mask of bits to be converted into strings.
/// \param
///      pString - pointer to the string into which the names should be stored.
/// \param
///      maxLength - the maximum number of characters (including the \0) that
///                  can be stored in pString.
/// \param
///      pBitNames - pointer to an array of strings for the bit names.
/// \param
///      numberOfNames - the number of bit names in the pBitNames array.
/// \param
///      pSeparatorString - the string to be placed between each name.
///
/// \retval
///      true if the string was created successfully.
/// \retval
///      false if the string pointer was NULL, or if the string was too short to
///          hold all of the characters (truncated).
