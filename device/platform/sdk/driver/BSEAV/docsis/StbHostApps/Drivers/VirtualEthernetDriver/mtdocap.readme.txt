In order to accomodate the multiple flash configurations that need to be supported by the mtdocap driver,
four new parameters have been introduced to represent the flash configurations for the four logical ocap
partitions we need to support. They are:

dyn - for the dynamic nonvol partition
perm - for the permanent nonvol partition
docsis0 - for the first docsis image partition
docsis1 - for the second docsis image partition

An additional optional parameter, docsishighram, is provided to specify the physical address of the top 2 megabytes of the
DOCSIS window. If not specified it defaults to 0xFE000000.

The docsis1 parameter is optional and if it is not provided then the partition will
not be mapped to a mtdocap minor device.

Each of the parameters has the same argument format consisting of four or five coma seperated integers specified
in either decimal or hex notation and representing:

1 - the minor device number of this mtdocap partition
2 - the minor device number of the mtd device where the partition resides.
3 - the start offset of the partition in bytes.
4 - the physical size of the partition in bytes
5 - the logical size of the partition in bytes

Except for NAND flash the logical and physical sizes should be the same. For NAND, the physical size may
be larger than the logical size and includes additional spare sectors.

Example of an insmod statement including these specifications:

insmod /root/mtdocap.ko debug=0 docsishighram=0xFE000000 \
        dyn=1,3,0x17a0000,0x40000,0x40000 \
        perm=2,3,0x17e0000,0x20000,0x20000 \
        docsis0=4,3,0x1800000,0x200000,0x200000 \
        docsis1=5,1,0x1000000,0x300000,0x200000
