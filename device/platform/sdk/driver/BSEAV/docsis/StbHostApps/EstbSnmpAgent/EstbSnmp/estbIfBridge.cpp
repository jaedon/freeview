               extension permits the additional value of zero.  the
               value zero is object-specific and must therefore be
               defined as part of the description of any object which
               uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of zero might

               On the first instantiation of an interface, the value

               An example of the value which a network manager might
               store in this object for a WAN interface is the
               (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface.

               For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active

ifTestTable   OBJECT-TYPE
       SYNTAX      SEQUENCE OF IfTestEntry
       MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
       STATUS      deprecated
       DESCRIPTION
               "This table contains one entry per interface.  It
               defines objects which allow a network manager to
               instruct an agent to test an interface for various
               faults.  Tests for an interface are defined in the
               media-specific MIB for that interface.  After invoking
               a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to
               determine the outcome.  If an agent can not perform
               the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The
               object ifTestCode can be used to provide further
               test-specific or interface-specific (or even
               enterprise-specific) information concerning the
               outcome of the test.  Only one test can be in progress
               on each interface at any one time.  If one test is in
               progress when another test is invoked, the second test
               is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when a
               prior test is active on another interface.

               Before starting a test, a manager-station must first
               obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for
               the interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with
               the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows:

            try_again:
                get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
                while (ifTestStatus != notInUse)
                   / *
                     * Loop while a test is running or some other
                     * manager is configuring a test.
                     * /
                    short delay
                    get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
                }

               / *
                 * Is not being used right now -- let's compete
                 * to see who gets it.
                 * /
                lock_value = ifTestId

                if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse,
                         ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE)
                   / *
                     * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go
                     * try again
                     * /
                    goto try_again;

               / *
                 * I have the lock
                 * /
                set up any test parameters.

               / *
                 * This starts the test
                 * /
                set(ifTestType = test_to_run);

                wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult

                when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult
                     agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse'

                retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId

                if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid

              A manager station first retrieves the value of the
              appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects,
              periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary,
              until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The
              manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId
              object to the value it just retrieved, the same
              ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding
              ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself.  If
              the set operation succeeds then the manager has
              obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of
              the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per
              the semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set
              operation indicates that some other manager has
              obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry.

              Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be
              setup, and then the test is initiated by setting
              ifTestType.  On completion of the test, the agent sets
              ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the
              manager can retrieve the results.  In the (rare) event
              that the invocation of tests by two network managers
              were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that
              the first test's results might be overwritten by the
              second test's results prior to the first results being
              read.  This unlikely circumstance can be detected by a
              network manager retrieving ifTestId at the same time as
              retrieving the test results, and ensuring that the
              results are for the desired request.

              If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long
              period of time after ownership is obtained, the agent
              should time-out the manager, and reset the value of the
              ifTestStatus object back to 'notInUse'.  It is
              suggested that this time-out period be 5 minutes.

              In general, a management station must not retransmit a
              request to invoke a test for which it does not receive
              a response; instead, it properly inspects an agent's
              MIB to determine if the invocation was successful.
              Only if the invocation was unsuccessful, is the
              invocation request retransmitted.

              Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-
              line in order to execute them, or may even require the
              agent to reboot after completion of the test.  In these
              circumstances, communication with the management
              station invoking the test may be lost until after
              completion of the test.  An agent is not required to
              support such tests.  However, if such tests are
              supported, then the agent should make every effort to
              transmit a response to the request which invoked the
              test prior to losing communication.  When the agent is
              restored to normal service, the results of the test are
              properly made available in the appropriate objects.
              Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned
              to an interface must be unchanged even if the test
              causes a reboot.  An agent must reject any test for
              which it cannot, perhaps due to resource constraints,
              make available at least the minimum amount of
              information after that test completes."
