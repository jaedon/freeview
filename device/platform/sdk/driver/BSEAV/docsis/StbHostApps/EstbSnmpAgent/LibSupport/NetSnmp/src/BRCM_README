NOTES AND BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------

This is NetSNMP ported for the eSTB SNMP Agent which runs on 
little endian MIPS Linux. These libraries need to be built after
the OpenSSL and SecLib libraries are built correctly. 
See "LibSupport/OpenSSL". Typically, the order is:

  build OpenSSL crypto library
  build SecLib library
  build NetSnmp libraries 
  build the agent 

This README deals with the "build NetSnmp libraries" step.
 
-----------------------------
Building The NetSnmp libraries:
-----------------------------

The NetSnmp libraries are:

  libnetsnmp_linux.a
  libnetsnmpagent_linux.a
  libnetsnmphelpers_linux.a
  libnetsnmpmibs_linux.a

To build the libraries, in the current directory run makeStblinux. 

  ./makeStblinux

Make sure that all four libs were built successfully. If there was an
error in the build of one library the others may successfully complete
and the error message will scroll off the screen.
     

--------------
Running configure:
--------------

You shouldn't have to run a configure unless you are going to a new
toolchain or target processor. 

You have to set up the include directory. Configure expects it to
be here, not in the lib directory, where we put it for the agent build.

  cd NetSnmp/src
  ln -s ../include include

Then just run the configure...

  ./brcmconfigure_stblinux

This will generate a bunch of makefiles which are never used. The reason
to run it is to generate some special include files that contain a
lot of host-specific definitions. Note that these have been heavily modified
for BRCM use, so you probably will want to save them off and then merge the
old files with the new ones. Then you can build the libraries.

If you need to clean up after the last configure, do this:

  make distclean

If "make distclean" starts running the native configure just do a <ctl> c and
run the brcm configure as above.

The include files that are generated are:

  include/net-snmp-config.h
  include/net-snmp/agent/mib_module_config.h 
  include/net-snmp/library/snmpv3-security-includes.h
  agent/mibgroup/mib_module_inits.h

You may need to merge the new include files with the old ones, and you MUST
merge net-snmp-config.h which is modified for the Broadcom build.
