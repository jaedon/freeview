NOTES AND BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------

This is OpenSSL version 0.9.8 and SecLib ported for the eSTB SNMP
Agent which runs on little endian MIPS Linux. These libraries need
to be built correctly and any changes made before the net-snmp
libraries are built. Typically, the order is:

build OpenSSL
build SecLib
build net-snmp
build the agent 


--------------
Editing Files:
--------------

IMPORTANT: HEADER FILES WITH THE SAME NAMES EXIST IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS.
BE SURE TO EDIT ALL HEADER FILES IN ALL LOCATIONS!

Note: Many of the OpenSSL header files appear in more than one place in the project structure.
For example, the file "opensslconf.h" is under "OpenSSL/include/openssl"	and is also under
"OpenSSL/crypto" and the file "e_os.h" is located under "OpenSSL/include/openssl" 
and "OpenSSL".  This is confusing but it is how it is in the OpenSSL distribution and
has not been changed.  So, for now, if you change a header file in one location, also change it 
in other locations if it exists.

-----------------------------
Building The OpenSSL Library:
-----------------------------
  -To build the OpenSSL library (libOpenSSLecos.a):
     Change to the "OpenSSL/crypto" directory and run "makeMipselLinux".
       
       cd crypto
       makeMipselLinux
 
     This creates the file "libOpenSSLLinux.a.gcc<major rev>.<minor rev)" 
     and copies it to the directory "LibSupport/OpenSSL" . The revision 
     numbers are the major and minor rev of the gcc compiler.

     If header files were changed, make sure they are changed in all places.

      
   

---------------------------------
Building The SecLib Library:
---------------------------------
  -To build the SecLib (SecLibLinux.a):
     Change to the "SecLib" directory and run "makeMipselLinux".
       
       cd SecLib
       makeMipselLinux
     
     This creates the file "SecLibLinux.a.gcc<major rev>.<minor rev)" 
     and copies it to the directory "LibSupport/OpenSSL" . The revision 
     numbers are the major and minor rev of the gcc compiler.
