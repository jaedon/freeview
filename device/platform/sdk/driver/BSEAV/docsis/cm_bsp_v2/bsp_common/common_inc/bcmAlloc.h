//  Description:
//      Helper functions to handle low-level, efficient buffer allocation and
//      deallocation for packets, buffer descriptors, packet descriptors, etc.
//      Buffer allocated by these methods are intended to be used for DMA, not
//      for general data storage (use malloc for general-purpose data buffers).

// With the updated BcmAlloc, you can set not only the number of buffers that
// are available, but also the buffer sizes and the number of sizes.  Previously
// you could only set the number of buffers; the buffer sizes were fixed.  This
// new method allows the all of the DMA buffer characteristics to be tuned
// according to the system requirements.
//
// For example, a simple bridging cable modem may only need 4 types of buffers
// (256 buffers of 16 bytes, 256 buffers of 48 bytes, 144 buffers of 288 bytes,
// and 600 buffers of 1650 bytes); on the other hand, a residential gateway may
// need 8 types of buffers, and more of them.
//
// NOTE:  When selecting buffer sizes, it is best to choose values that are
// multiples of the DCache line size.  If you choose a value that is not a
// multiple of the cache line size, we will have to pad it out to fill the
// cache line anyway in order avoid coherency problems due to flushing and
// invalidating.

// This function MUST be called by a client (prior to calling BcmAllocInit) to

// the buffer allocations to be tuned for different platforms based on the
// number and type of interfaces that are enabled, application features, etc.

//
// Parameters:
//      bufferConfig - struct containing the buffer allocations to be used.
//
// Returns:  Nothing.
//
void BcmAllocConfigure(BcmAllocBufferConfig bufferConfig);

// Returns the maximum buffer size that was configured in BcmAllocConfigure(),
// and that has buffers assigned for that size (it is possible to configure a
// size with 0 buffers).
//
// This used to be a constant, but now it is configurable, so you must query
// it.
//
// Parameters:  None.
//
// Returns:
//      The maximum buffer size that can be allocated via BcmAlloc().
//
uint16 BcmAllocGetMaxBufferSize(void);

// Called by drivers to get the BcmAlloc driver to initialize its memory pool.
// It is safe to call this more than once; the buffers will only be allocated
// once.
//
// Parameters:  None.
//
// Returns:
//      0 if it initialized successfully.
//      -1 if there was a problem.
//
int BcmAllocInit(void);

// Allocates a buffer of the specified size, and returns a pointer to it.  The
// buffer will be at least the specified number of bytes, but may be larger.
// If the request can't be satisfied (size too big, or no more buffers
// available) then we will return NULL.
//
// The dcache associated with the buffer will be invalidated unless you pass in
// FALSE as the invalidate parameter.  If you are allocating the buffer for
// receive DMA purposes, then you MUST specify TRUE for this parameter.  If you
// are allocating the buffer so that s/w can write to it and then use it for
// transmit DMA, then you can specify FALSE, since you're going to overwrite
// whatever is in dcache anyway.
//
// NOTE:  All buffer sizes can now be used for DMA operations.
//
// Parameters:
//      bufferSize - the buffer size (in bytes) to allocate.
//      cached - TRUE to return the buffer in cached memory space, FALSE to
//               return the buffer in noncached memory space.
//      invalidate - TRUE if the dcache associated with the buffer should be
//                   invalidated, FALSE if we can skip invalidation.  You should
//                   only pass in FALSE if you are allocating a cached buffer,
//                   and if s/w will be writing to it (not for receive DMA).
//
// Returns:
//      A pointer to the buffer allocated, or NULL if none available.

// each Buffer Descriptor.  Doing a bulk alloc can save a good deal of CPU time
// since the work of finding the appropriate buffer, handling interrupt locking,
// promoting buffers, etc, will only be done once.
//
// Parameters:
//      bufferSize - the buffer size (in bytes) to allocate.
//      numBuffers - the number of buffers of bufferSize bytes to allocate.
//      pBufferArray - pointer to an array of void *'s; the allocated buffers
//                     will be stored in this array.  The array must contain
//                     at least numBuffers entries.
//      cached - TRUE to return the buffers in cached memory space, FALSE to
//               return the buffers in noncached memory space.
//      invalidate - TRUE if the dcache associated with the buffers should be
//                   invalidated, FALSE if we can skip invalidation.  You should
//                   only pass in FALSE if you are allocating a cached buffer,
//                   and if s/w will be writing to it (not for receive DMA).

// Returns:
//      The number of buffers that were actually allocated.  This will be less
//      than or equal to numBuffers.

// Frees a buffer previously allocated via BcmAlloc or BcmBulkAlloc.
//
// You also need to indicate the number of bytes that were used in the buffer
// (-1 means all of them).  This is used to update the buffer statistics so that
// we know how many bytes to invalidate when it is allocated next time.  For
// example, if you allocated a 1600 byte buffer, but only used 64 bytes, then
// specifying 64 for bytesUsed will keep us from having to invalidate 1600 bytes
// when it is next allocated.
//
// However, if you play tricks with the buffer, such as carving structures out
// at the end of the buffer, then there will be a disjoint region of used data
// within the buffer, all of which needs to be invalidated.  In this case, your
// options are:
//
//   Safe - specify -1 for bytesUsed so that the whole buffer is invalidated.
//   Fast - invalidate the structure area at the end yourself, then specify the
//          number of bytes used from the rest of the buffer that were used.
//
// NOTE:  If this buffer was not allocated using BcmAlloc or BcmBulkAlloc, the
//        system can crash!
//
// Parameters:
//      pMemory - pointer to memory to be freed.
//      bytesUsed - the number of bytes that were used (-1 means all of them).

// Return:  Nothing.
