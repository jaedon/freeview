Sample Code

You can find sample application code in three places:

1. Inside the documentation. This is the smallest and easiest to understand, but it
doesn't show the full features of bcmplayer.

2. BSEAV/api/src/*/bsettop_playback.c. This is the PVR implementation for the
reference software. It is part of the Settop API and is a complete implementation.

3. BSEAV/api/utils/playback. This is an application that uses the Settop API. It doesn't
use bcmplayer directly, but it's a simple and useable app.
