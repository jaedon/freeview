* Summary:
* Search for the index which most closely matches the pts using the current location as a starting point.

* Description:
* It does not change the current index.
*
* This function was written with two usage modes in mind:
* o Using the decoder's current PTS, converted to an index, to position the PVR cursor in a GUI
* o Using the decoder's current PTS, converted to an index, to relocate the player for trick mode transitions.
*
* Both modes assume you are using the decoder's current PTS. Because of this, we maintain a cache of picture's PTS
* and index values that have recently been sent to the decoder. This is efficient and will work regardless of the
* trick mode speed used (even very fast speeds). Because of PTS discontinuities, an index-wide binary search
* for a PTS is impossible anyway; therefore this narrow definition of PTS search is acceptible.
*
* Initially this function only ever searched from newest to oldest when trying to find a match. This is the simplest
* and most reliable scheme, but the tradeoff is that the more compressed pictures that fit in a decoder's compressed
* picture buffer, the more entries we need to maintain in our cache, and the longer the search becomes.
* In order to mitigate this, the function now does a backward search on trick mode transitions / decoder cache flushes,
* and thereafter maintains a read ptr to the last found cache hit ( minus back off ), and searches forward from this
* point.
*
* This function also now interpolates the index value for streams which have all the pictures in a GOP encoded with
* the same PTS.
*
* If you get bad index values back, you should also see BDBG_ERR messages stating that the PTS diff exceeded a minimum
* threshold. In this case, you are either using this function in an unsupported way (i.e. searching for PTS
* values that have not been recently decoded), or you need to expand the internal cache size (see
* PTS_CACHE_SIZE in the implementation).
*
* If you want to do index-wide searches, you should use other values like index number, MPEG offset or
* timestamp.
*
* Return values:
* -1 = failure
* Otherwise returns the index number.
