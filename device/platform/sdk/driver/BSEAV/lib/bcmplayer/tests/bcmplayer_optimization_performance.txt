Bcmplayer optimizations

-----------------------------------
Test technique:

I used the bcmplayback test_app which is found in:

	SetTop/linux/application/driverintf/test_apps/playback

It depends on the linux kernelmode driver and libdriverintf.a.
Then I used the command-line scripting feature and the bash "time" utility.

For example:
	To time normal play: time ./bcmplayer -once -scrtext "wait;st;q" ...
	To time rewind:      time ./bcmplayer -once -scrtext "g 3194;7;wait;st;q" ...

In the final results, the difference between bytes read and played are the
software-generated BTP packets.

File information:

Index length: 3194 frames
File size: 38598656 bytes

-----------------------------------
Normal Playback:
	time: 1m 44s
	bytes read: 38195200
	bytes played: 38195200

	NOTE: 3194/30 = 106 which is about 104 seconds. The difference is the initial
		frames preceding the seqhdr which are thrown away by bcmplayer.

1x Rewind:
	time: 1m 59s
	bytes read: 318727368
	bytes played: 327116800

1x Rewind w/ EXTRA_B:
	time: 1m 55s
	bytes read: 222069612
	bytes played: 227993600

1x Rewind w/ EXTRA_B and DUMMY_PICTURE:
	time: 1m 54s
	bytes read: 202668200
	bytes played: 208332800

1x Rewind w/ EXTRA_B, DUMMY_PICTURE and DISPLAY_PAST_BUFFER:
	time: 1m 46s
	bytes read: 120913204
	bytes played: 124672000
