Using buildfont

The buildfont utility uses bwin and freetype to build bwin-format prerendered font
files. These font files can be used with any bwin-based application, like Brutus.

The following are step by step instructions for building and using buildfont.

Do this on the build server:

	# you need to make clean in case bwin was built without FREETYPE_SUPPORT
	make clean

	# this will build the buildfont utility
	make -f Makefile.buildfont

	# copy it to a location where refsw binaries are run (i.e. where brutus is run)
	cp buildfont $DESTDIR

Do this on the settop:

	# run without params first to see usage
	nexus buildfont 

	# here's a sample
	nexus buildfont /mnt/nfs/font.ttf 10 1 fonts/test.bwin_font

	# edit brutus.cfg to use the font and add the following option
	NORMAL_FONT=fonts/test.bwin_font;-1

Now run brutus. You should see the new font in use.
