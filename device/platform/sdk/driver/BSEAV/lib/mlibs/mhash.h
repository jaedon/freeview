/* 
   ONLY DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED DATA MAY BE ADDED TO MHASH USING THE DEFAULT 
   CONSTUCTOR ARGUMENT.  THAT DATA WILL THEN BELONG TO THE MHASH
   OBJECT, AND WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY DELETED WHEN THE MHASH IS DELETED.  DO NOT 
   DELETE THE DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED DATA ELSEWHERE OR ***MEMORY CORRUPTION*** WILL 
   RESULT!

   CARE MUST ALSO BE TAKEN NOT TO ADD THE SAME DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED DATA TO
   MULTIPLE MHASHS OR MAUTOLISTS (OR THEIR SUBCLASSES).

   IF YOU NEED MHASH TO STORE STATICALLY ALLOCATED DATA OR YOU WISH TO 
   FREE DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED DATA FROM OUTSIDE THE MHASH 
   OBJECT, YOU MUST CALL THE MHASH CONSTRUCTOR WITH THE ARGUMENT, AUTODELETE
   SET TO FALSE!  OR, YOU COULD USE THE REMOVE METHOD TO RETURN RESPONSIBILITY 
   FOR THE DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED DATA TO THE CALLING CODE.  CALLING THE REMOVE() 
   METHOD WILL REMOVE THEY DATA FROM THE MHASH, AND WILL RELINQUISH RESPONSIBILITY 
   FOR THE MEMORY MANAGEMENT AS WELL.  IN THIS CASE, CALLING CODE WILL NEED TO 
   FREE THE DATA WHEN IT IS NO LONGER NEEDED.  THE REMOVE METHOD OPERATES IN 
   THIS MANNER REGARDLESS OF THE STATE OF THE AUTODELETE FLAG.
