/*****************************************************************************
Summary:
This function implements different DSA operations in SW.


Description:
This function implements different DSA operations in software.
The inputs include DSA key, input data, size of the input data, output signature, size of the 
output signature, the values of r and s for the signature to be verified, and the dsa operation 
parameter. Different DSA operations that are supported are DSA Sign and DSA Verify. 


Calling Context:
The function shall be called from application level or from driver level, for example in Linux
during insmod.


Performance and Timing:
This is a synchronous/blocking function that will not return until it is done or failed.


Input:
hBcrypt  - BCRYPT_Handle
pInputParam - BCRYPT_S_DSASwParam_t, a ref/pointer to the parameters for SW 
			DSA operations.

			
Returns:
BCRYPT_STATUS_eOK - success
BCRYPT_STATUS_eFAILED - failure
