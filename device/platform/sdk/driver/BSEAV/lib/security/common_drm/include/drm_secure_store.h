/**********************************************************************************************
DRM_SecureStore_BufferOperation

Performs AES-ECB operation on a 16-byte aligned source buffer using a unique chip (OTP) key.  
If the 'src_length' is not 16-byte aligned the function will return an error.  
The caller will have the option to perform encryption/decryption 'in place'
or 'external' by specifying a destination buffer which should also
have been allocated with the proper size and be 16-byte aligned.   
 
Input Parameters:
pSrc
    Type: uint8_t*
    Purpose:Source buffer containing the data. Should be allocated from the heap.

src_length
    Type: uint32_t
    Purpose: specifies the length of the source buffer. Must be 16-byte aligned

destType
    Type:
    Purpose: If the caller specifies 'DrmDestinationType_eInPlace', pSrc must 
            equal pDest.
            If the caller specifies 'DrmDestinationType_eExternal', pSrc must 
            differ from pDest.
drmOp
    Type: DrmCryptoOperation
    Purpose: DrmCryptoOperation_eEncrypt (encryption)
             DrmCryptoOperation_eDecrypt (decryption)

Output Parameters:
pDest
    Type: uint8_t* 
    Purpose: Destination buffer that will contain the resulting data. Should be 
             allocated from the heap and be at least the same size as 'src_length'.

Returns: 
              On Success:   Drm_Success
              On Failure:   any other error code.

/**********************************************************************************************
DrmRC DRM_SecureStore_FileOperation

Similar to 'DRM_SecureStore_BufferOperation'.
If a 'read' operation is specified by the caller, the function will fetch its source data by attempting 
to read and decrypt (AES-ECB)the contents specified by 'file_path'.
If a 'write' operation is specified by the caller, the function will encrypt (AES-ECB) the source buffer 
passed to it and create a binary file at the location specified by 'file_path'

Input/Output Parameter:
pBuf 
    Type:  uint8_t*
    Purpose:  Buffer containing either the data to write to file OR will contain the data read from a file. 
              Should be allocated from the heap.

Input Parameters: 

buf_length 
    Type: uint32_t
    Purpose: specifies the length of the buffer to write to a file (write operation) OR specifies the length 
            of the data to read and decrypt from a file (read operation).  Must be 16-byte aligned
file_path
    Type:  char*
    Purpose:  Specifies the location of where to create the file in the case of a write operation OR
              specifies the location of where to read the contents of the source buffer in the case 
              of a read operation.
fileOp
    Type:  DrmFileOperation
    Purpose: DrmFileOperation_eWrite (write)
              DrmFileOperation_eRead (read)
drmOp
    Type:  DrmCryptoOperation
    Purpose: DrmCryptoOperation_eEncrypt (encryption)
             DrmCryptoOperation_eDecrypt (decryption)

Returns: 
              On Success:   Drm_Success
              On Failure:   any other error code.

* 
* This functions is used to encrypt a data buffer and save it encrypted in a file. Note that if

* bufSize 
*     Purpose: specifies the length of the buffer to write to a file.

* DrmRC DRM_SecureStore_AlignedFileDecRead
* 
* This functions is used to read the content of a file, decrypt it and copy the decrypted data into
* the buffer pointed to by pBuf. The number of bytes copieds is returned into bufSize. An application can
* call this function and set pBuf to NULL to figure out how much memory it needs to allocate.
* 
* For example:
* 
* Figure out the size of the data to read:
* ...
* rc =  DRM_SecureStore_AlignedFileDecRead("file.bin", NULL, &bufSize);
* 
* pBuf = (uint8_t *)BKNI_Malloc(bufSize);
* 
* Read data from file
* rc =  DRM_SecureStore_AlignedFileDecRead("file.bin", pBuf, &bufSize);
* ...
* 
* Input/Output Parameter:
* pBuf 
*     Type:  uint8_t*
*     Purpose:  Buffer Where the decrypted data will be copied into. When the parameter is NULL,
*     the function only returns the size of the data saved in the file.
* 
* bufSize 
*     Type: uint32_t
*     Purpose: Specifies the length of the buffer in bytes.
* 
* Input Parameters: 
*
* pPath
*     Type:  char*
*     Purpose:  Specifies the location of the fi.
* 
* Returns: 
*     On Success:   Drm_Success
*     On Failure:   any other error code.
