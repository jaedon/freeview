/*================== Module Overview =====================================
This module is a helper moduie that provides implementation of time queue.
Elements could be pushed into the queue, popped from the queue, or could be 
extracted from the queue appplying timestamp manangement (TSM) algorigthm.

This modules uses 32bit time to communication timestamps, those timestamps are in the user defined units,
it could be either miliseconds, 45KHz or 90KHz units. Eventhough module doesn't need to know what units are, 
it's the users responsibility to use consistant units with a given instance of btsm_queue_t.

This module doesn't reorder entires, and output order matches input order. What it only does
it paces elements based on their timestamp and/or interpolated duration.

    When function returns btsm_queue_action_drop, it's advisable to call function again with the same timestamp,

Returns:
    btsm_queue_action_repeat  - no new data avaliable, entry is left in undefined state 
    btsm_queue_action_display -  removes top element from the queue and returns it to application, it's advised to display  returned element
    btsm_queue_action_drop - removes top element from the queue and returns it to application, it's advised to drop  returned element.
