Soft-float support

Compiling from checked in binaries is deprecated. Please use the code in the src subdirectory.

I've taken the original fp-bit.c and created two files. The difference is that one defined FLOAT and
the other guarantees that FLOAT is not defined. This provides for both single and double 
precision float support.

This code is included from the linux 2.4.25 release directory.

As noted in the source file, this code is licensed under GPL with a special exception which
grants permission to link without transferring GPL to the linked code.
