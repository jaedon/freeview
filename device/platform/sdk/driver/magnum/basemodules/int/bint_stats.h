Summary:
Enables statistics tracking of callbacks.

Description:
Enables tracking of statistics for the interrupt module.  Must be called for
statistics to be tracked.  If enabled, a call to BINT_Stats_Disable is
required before the module is closed with BINT_Close.

Access to a shared freerun timer from the TMR module will be acquired when
stats tracking is enabled.

Summary:
Disables statistics tracking of callbacks.

Description:
Disables tracking of statistics for the interrupt module.  Must be called before
the module is closed with BINT_Close if stats tracking was enabled with
BINT_Stats_Enable.

Disabling stats tracking also relinquishes access to the shared freerun timer
acquired when tracking was enabled.

/*
Summary:
Adds a statistics bin to a callback.

Description:
Adds a bin with a minimum and maximum time range in microseconds.  The ulBinHitCount
field will be incremented in this bin everytime the execution of the callback falls
within the time range.  Returns an error if maximum number of bins is exceeded or
if the max and min ranges overlap or fall within an existing bin's range.  No two
bins can have overlapping ranges.

Adding a bin removes the default bins for a callback.

Destroys and clears out the created stats bins of a given callback.

Summary:
Gets the statistics of a callback.

Description:
Gets the statistics of a specific callback.  It returns the pointer to the BINT_CallbackStats
structure associated with the callback.  The BINT_CallbackStats structure is constantly being
updated, each time the callback executes.  It may be necessary to use critical sections when
reading from the callback structure to make sure the stats don't update in mid-read.

are disabled by default.

reset when this function is called.
