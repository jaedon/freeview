/*=*************************************************************************
The purpose of the metrics interface is to provide a standard way of
monitoring kernel interface usage. This meets a basic requirement of the Magnum
architecture which is to improve system performance. One simple way of doing this is
to know who is sleeping and blocking and for how long. Grep'ing code can find
these spots, but it can't tell you how frequently and for how long these calls
are being made.

No Magnum code is allowed to call the metrics interface. It is only callable
by system level code.

The metrics interface can be turned off or compiled out. If you don't want the overhead,
you're not required to have it. However, we do require that every platform
should implement the metrics interface so that it can be used if desired.

See bkni.h for a kernel interface overview.

	functions.

	Also, the output mechanism may be the debug interface, BKNI_Printf or some other
	means. If it is the debug interface, you must also enable the correct
	debug level for the kernel interface module. The exact implementation of this
	is up to the platform developer.
