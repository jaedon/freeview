/*=*************************************************************************
Summary:
The event group implements event multiplexing. An application
can group multiple events and then wait in the single thread any of these
events to be set.

The BKNI_EventGroup kernel interface is an optional component of the kernel interface.
It shall not be used by the porting interface, base modules or common utilites.
It is only for application needs.

Example:
  #include "bkni_event_group.h"

  ...
  BKNI_EventHandle event1, event2;
  BKNI_EventHandle events[2];
  unsigned nevents;

  BKNI_EventGroupHandle group;

  BKNI_CreateEvent(&event1);
  BKNI_CreateEvent(&event2);

  BKNI_CreateEventGroup(&group);

  BKNI_AddEventGroup(group, event1);
  BKNI_AddEventGroup(group, event2);

  BKNI_WaitForGroup(group, 1000, events, 2, &nevents);

  printf("Got %d events", nevents);

Description:
 This function waits for the any event from the group. This function

 the events structure.
 After the event is saved in the user specified area, the event is cleared out.
