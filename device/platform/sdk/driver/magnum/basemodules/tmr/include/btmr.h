/*= Module Overview *********************************************************
<verbatim>

Overview
Timer module represents a generalize representatiion of a hardware timer.  The 
basic function of a timer is to count.  Some timers count up, while others count
down.  If the timer is given a specific time period, a callback routine (ISR level)
must be provided.  This callback will be used for notification that the timer expired.

This interface requires a set of timers to be opened.  Once opened, timers from
the set can be created, started & stopped, and then destroyed as needed.  When
the timers are no longer required they can be closed.  Unless an exclusive timer
is requested, all created timers are virtual.

Design
The design for BTMR PI API is broken into three parts.

o Part 1 (open/close):

    These APIs are used for opening and closing a general BTMR device.
    This defines a set of timers that can be created/destroyed dynamically.

o Part 2 (create/destroy):

    These APIs are used for dynamically allocating an available timer.
    Once created, a timer can be started/stopped/read as desired.
    When the timer is no longer needed it can be destroyed.

o Part 3 (start/stop/read):

    These APIs are used for starting and stopping a timer.  The timer can
    be read to get the current time value.

Usage
The usage of BTMR involves the following:

   * Opening a set of timers
   * Allocating a timer from the set (create)
   * Start timer
   * Stop/Read timer
   * Destroying the timer
   * Closing the set of timers

===================
Types of timers and timer types:
There are three types of timers (exclusive, shared, and virtual) and three timer types (stop-watch/free-run, count-down,
and periodic).  If a timer is needed, first choose the type of timer based on the description and usage notes below.
Then choose the timer type based on the timer requirements and restrictions (see "enum BTMR_Type" below).

Types of timers:
exclusive timer: Not virtual and not shared.  Can be manipulated with or without this API.
shared timer: Not virutal and shared by other shared timer requestors.  Cannot be started/stopped.
virtual timer: Cannot request its registers for external manipulation.

Timer types:
countdown: Counts down from initial value to zero.  Stops and calls back when timer reaches zero.
periodic: Counts down from initial value to zero.  Calls back when timer reaches zero and restarts on return from callback.
stopwatch/free-run: Counts up and wraps at maximum timer value.

===================
Exclusive timers:
Exclusive access can be requested when creating a timer.  This will prevent the timer from being virtualized
or shared with other requestors.  You can request the registers of an exclusive timer and control it directly
by manipulating the registers or by using the supplied API functions.  Care should be taken to NOT mix the
control (i.e. using this API and direct register control) as state information is saved when using the PI.
If a callback function is registered at the create, this PI will call the supplied callback function when
the countdown/periodic timer expires even if the timer is controlled externally.

Usage notes: There are a limited set of exclusive timers and the create will fail if no timer is available.
This type of timer should be used when the timer control is to be done using firmware by a sub-processor
or DSP that has access to the hardware register space and has need to start and stop the timer at different times.
The software would create the timer, request the location of the allocated timer's registers, and pass the location
to the underlying hardware/firmware.  If the hardware/firmware has need to read, but not stop/start the timer, then
a shared timer should be used instead.

===================
Shared timers:
A shared timer (BTMR_Type_eSharedFreeRun) is a stop watch timer that can only be read.  That is, it is a free running
timer that cannot be started or stopped (its always running, counting up).  A shared timer will create a (physical)
timer on the first request for a shared timer and then provide the same timer handle to subsequent shared timer create
requests.  This timer will be started on first create and stopped on the last destroy.  Because this timer is shared
with other requestors it cannot be started or stopped using this PI (only read).  Because a shared timer is a stop
watch timer it cannot be supplied with a callback function.

Usage notes: A shared timer, like a exculsive timer, should be used used when access to the timer's registers is needed
but when the external hardware/firmware does not need to start and stop the timer.

Warning: The exclusive flag is ignored when using shared timers.  This API lets you get the register locations of the
(one) shared timer.  Care should be taken to NOT WRITE those registers (i.e. start/stop the timer). 
Doing so would disrupt the usage of the shared timer and all its users.

===================
Virtual timers:
Unless an exclusive or shared timer is requested, all other timers are considered virtual.
That is, one physical timer is (allocated) used to create an unlimited set of virtual timers.  The only difference
in functionality is that a virtual timer cannot control the timer outside of this API (i.e. you CANNOT request the
pointer to it's registers) and additional overhead is needed to process the virtual timer.
Attempting to get the registers (BTMR_GetTimerRegisters) of a virtual timer will fail.

Usage notes: A virtual timer should be used whenever access to the timer's registers is not needed (i.e. controlled
outside of this PI).  This should be the default.

===================
Interrupt Requirements:
Callback functions are supplied on some timer types at creation time.  These callbacks are called in interrupt
context and MUST not call functions that aren't designated as ISR safe functions.  It is okay to restart a
countdown timer from the callback and to stop a periodic timer from the callback but the timer should NEVER be 
destroyed from the callback.

===================
Timer resolutions:
Timeouts and initial values are supplied in microsecond increments.  Reading the timer value using the PI returns a
value in microsecond increments.  Reading an exclusive or shared timer by using the timer registers will be in
timer tick values (based on 27Mhz clock).  A conversion function is supplied in this PI (BTMR_TimerToMicroSeconds).

A timeout or initial value must not exceed: 39,768,215 microseconds (39,768 milli-seconds or 39.7 seconds).
The function "BTMR_ReadTimerMax" can be used to get this value.

===================
Sample Code

volatile bool interrupt = false;
static void myIntHandler(context *myParam1, int myParam2) { interrupt = true; }

void main( void )
{
    BTMR_Handle      hTimerDevice;
    BTMR_DeviceSettings  deviceSettings;
    BREG_Handle      hReg;
    BCHP_Handle      hChip;
    BINT_Handle      hInt;
    BTMR_TimerHandle hTimer;
    
    // Do other initialization, i.e. for BREG, BCHP, BINT, etc.

    // Now, ready to setup the BTMR

    // Get defaults and make any changes required 
    BTMR_GetDefaultDeviceSettings(&deviceSettings);
    deviceSettings.timerMask = 0; // defines the timers to reserve for external use (none)

    BTMR_Open(&hTimerDevice, hChip, hReg, hInt, &deviceSettings);

    // Timers are now ready for use.

    // Create and start a timer.
    {
        BTMR_TimerSettings timerSettings = { BTMR_Type_eCountDown, (BTMR_CallbackFunc)myIntHandler, NULL, 0, false };
        BTMR_CreateTimer(hTimerDevice, &hTimer, &timerSettings);
        BTMR_StartTimer(hTimer, 1000); // interrupt in 1000 usec or 1 millisecond
    }

    while (!interrupt) ; // wait for timer to go off!

    BTMR_StopTimer(hTimer);
    BTMR_DestroyTimer(hTimer);

    BTMR_Close(hTimerDevice);
}

Summary:

Description:
    This defines the timer set (set of timers) information.
    Legacy code exists that uses a particular timer outside of this interface.  
    The 'timerMask' mask defines which timers should not be included in the list of timers 
    controlled by this API.  
    Virtual timers require the use of two physical timers.  Setting preallocUtilTimers 
    to true forces these timers to be allocated statically at the Open call.  Setting it to
    false (default) will allocate these timers dynamically on first request for a virtual timer.
    The base register value defines the alternate set of timers to be used by the returned handle.  
    The interrupt number defines the level two interrupt that is registered for the alternate set
    of timers.  This flags the driver into handling the individual timers as level 3 interrupts.

Usage:
    When using an alternate timer block the following settings should be used to define the
    alternate timer block.  It is assumed that if the interrupt number parameter is defined that
    the specified interrupt will be used as a level two interrupt.

Summary:
    Returns a structure that supplies the registers for this timer.

Description:
    When a timer is created in exclusive mode, it will not be controlled by timer start/stop/read functions.
    Instead, it will be controlled externally.  If a callback function is supplied, then, when an interrupt
    for that timer is generated, the call back function will be called.

Note:
    This function can also be used on a shared timer (BTMR_Type_eSharedFreeRun).  Because this timer is
    shared by other users, care should be taken to NOT start or stop this timer.  If you get the registers
    and stop the timer other user's code will break.  This was done because of the limited number of timers
    available.

Returns:
    A structure that contains the offsets for the registers for this timer.
