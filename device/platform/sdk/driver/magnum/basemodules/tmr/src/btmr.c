 *
 * Module Description:
 *  This is a magnum PI module used to control the hardware timers of a BCM7xxx part.
 *  This provides a means to create/destroy and start/stop timers when required.
 *
 * Revision History:
 *
 * $brcm_Log: /magnum/basemodules/tmr/src/btmr.c $
 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/37   11/5/12 4:23p rjlewis
 * SW7552-346: Added support for Standby and Resume.  Standby includes
 * prints if any times are still open.
 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/36   7/23/12 11:05a rjlewis
 * SW7425-3559: Misplaced curlies.
 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/35   7/11/12 12:43p rjlewis
 * SW7425-2989: print handles to make finding deleting previously deleted
 * time easier to find.  Also remove path from filenames.
 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/34   2/21/12 2:19p erickson
 * SW7425-2130: fix debug warnings
 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/33   8/26/11 5:03p rjlewis
 * SW7425-1187: locking semaphore didn't lock enough.  Need to block all
 * other creates without impeding recursive creates (so creating virtual
 * timer can create the two physical timers needed to process virtual
 * timers).
 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/32   8/25/11 12:39p rjlewis
 * SW7425-1187: added compile options for handling missing destroy calls.
 * Added mutexes to protect counts (fixes dual destroy fail).  Added
 * tagged for destroy.  General cleanup.
 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/31   8/18/11 4:29p rjlewis
 * SW7346-460: comment around a coverity issue.
 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/30   8/18/11 4:10p rjlewis

 * created.
 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/29   8/18/11 3:36p rjlewis
 * SW7346-460: make sure free-run timer was created before trying to
 * destroy.
 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/28   8/16/11 6:50p rjlewis

 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/26   8/10/11 3:58p rjlewis

 * on close with missing destroy.
 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/25   8/10/11 2:40p rjlewis
 * SW3548-2526: don't include ANY std includes -- causes compile issues.
 * Don't use stdlib functions (compile errors).  clarify that location is
 * creation location.
 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/24   8/9/11 9:59a rjlewis
 * SW3548-2526: Removed unused include that was causing build error on
 * some platforms.
 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/23   8/8/11 2:54p rjlewis
 * SW3548-2526: Merged in virtual timer branch. PR22129: SW3548-2526:
 * incorrectly using unsigned long and uint32_t where unsigned correct.
 * Missing leave critical in read.  fixed names of values to reflect
 * where converted to ticks.  Fixed bug: not setting default timer
 * register offset. SWDTV-5441: added support for secondary timer block.
 * Fixed return variables from uint32 to uslongs. SW3548-2526: General
 * clean-up SW3548-2526: general cleanup.  Added jump tables for
 * virt/phys processing. Keep track of virtual timers.  Added _isr where
 * required.  Uses one less phys timer. SW35230-935: update branch so I
 * can continue virtual timer changes before merging back into main.
 * SW7550-300: Read physical timers value instead of virtual to get the
 * time elapsed before deciding where to place new timer. SW7550-197:
 *

 * 
 * Hydra_Software_Devel/22   8/17/10 5:46p rjlewis
 * SW35230-935: Added support for tagged version of create (so we can find
 * where timers are being created).

 * (exclusive & shared) won't hang.
 * Cleaned up unregistering of callbacks on close.
 * Cleaned up message debug prints and entry/exit prints.
 *

*/

/* Shared Timer Notes:
** The concept of a shared timer was added prior to adding virtual timers.  This allowed users to request a physical timer
** for reading only (delay operations) but share it with other requestors.  A physical timer is used for this purpose.
** Since the address to this timer is returned to each requestor (that wants to read the time without using this PI) 
** it is possible for any of the users to stop the timer -- this would be bad!  When virtual timers were introduced it was 
** decided to keep the shared timer as there is firmware in ancillary processors/dsps that can't use the PI but can read the 
** timer registers.  This lets them use a timer without having to use a unique physical timer.
*/

/* Virtual Timer Notes:
** This interface supports two types of virtual timers: stop-watch (or free-run) and count-down.
** One physical timer is used for the virtual count-down timer and the shared timer is used to support the virtual free-run timers.
** The physical timer for count-down timers is ONLY used to generate the interrupt.  All the time calculations are done
** using the shared free-run timer (for both the virtual count-down and virtual free-run timers).
** 
** When a count-down timer is pending, the physical timer counts the virtual count-down timer that has the smallest count-down period.
** A sorted list of the count-down timers is managed.  When a count-down timer is added to the list it is added in the list
** based on its timeout time before an item that has a larger timeout period.  The difference between that item and its
** preceeding entry defines how long the timeout needs to be for that timer.
** 
** The timer for free-run virtual timers is started at open time and the current time is used to provide the caller
** with a virtual time value (using the time when the user created the virtual timer).
*/

/* TODO:
** 1) Instead of using two timers to support virtual timers, try to use the free-run timer for the timeout by just letting it run 
** but set a new match value for the next timeout.  The pain would be in the inserting of a new virtual count-down timer that is
** less (smaller timeout) than the one that is currently running.  To calculate the time already run would be a bit more math.
** 2) Allow reading the registers for a virtual stop-watch timer (return the registers for the free-run timer used for supporting
** the virtual timers).  Then convert the create request for a shared timer to a virtual stop-watch and delete the concept of a
** shared timer from the documentation (depricated).
** 3) BTMR_ReadTimer should not return status as it can never fail -- return value instead.  This would require a change to the PI.
** 4) Change BTMR_ReadTimerMax to allow specifying a handle in case future timers blocks have different wrap points.
