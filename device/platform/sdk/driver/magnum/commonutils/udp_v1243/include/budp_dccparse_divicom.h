Overview
BUDPCCparse_divicom module provides parsing of digital closed caption
data in an older, DiviCom-specific format.  Digital closed caption
data occurs as userdata in MPEG bitstreams.

This software accepts a buffer of data that contains the MPEG
userdata.  It parses out the closed caption data, and returns it
as a pair of bytes.  These two bytes can then be sent directly to
a digital (EIA-708-B) closed caption encoder.  Byte pairs that have
an associated bIsAnalog value of "true" may be sent directly to an
analog closed caption (line 21) encoder.

  Summary:
    Parses digital closed caption data from a buffer of userdata containing
	closed caption data in proprietary "Divicom" format.

  Description:
    This function accepts a "packet" of userdata and searches it for
    digital closed caption data. The closed caption data shall be in a
    proprietary format started by DiviCom Inc.

	In order to avoid having an output array of indefinite
	length, this function will only parse at most one "packet"
	of userdata from its input.  A "packet" is defined as the
	userdata that lies between two successive userdata start
	codes (0x000001B2).  Therefore, several calls to this
	function may be necessary to parse out all the userdata.
	Parsing will be complete when the function returns a
	*pBytesParsed argument such that (offset + *pBytesParsed ==
	pUserdata_info->ui32UserDataBufSize).

	Consider that the closed caption data can only be
	encoded analog if the associated bIsAnalog field is set.
	This consideration, together with the need to call the
	function multiple times (previous paragraph) implies that
	the typical usage of this function is as follows:

    size_t offset = 0;
    while (offset < info->ui32UserDataBufSize)
    {
        eStatus = 
            BUDP_DCCparse_Divicom_isr (
				info, offset, &bytesParsed, &cc_count, ccdata);
        if (eStatus == BERR_SUCCESS)
        {
            int icount;
            for (icount = 0 ; icount < cc_count ; ++icount)
            {
                BUDP_DCCparse_ccdata* pccdata = &ccdata[icount];
                if (pccdata->bIsAnalog == true)
                {
				     // Send pccdata->cc_data_1 and pccdata->cc_data_2
					 // to analog closed caption encoder, if any.  These
					 // bytes must be sent on video field with polarity
					 // pcc->polarity.
                }
				// Possibly, send pccdata->cc_data_1 and pccdata->cc_data_2 
				// to digital closed caption encoder.  The customer must
				// know if EIA-708-B processing is appropriate.
            }
        }
		else if (eStatus == BERR_BUDP_NO_DATA)
		{
			// Just keep looping, there may be more data to process.
		}
		else
		{
            // A real error, get out quick.
            return eStatus;
		}
		offset += bytesParsed;
	}

  Returns:
  	BERR_SUCCESS              - The handle was successfully created.
	BERR_INVALID_PARAMETER    - One of the supplied parameters was invalid,
							    possibly NULL.
	BERR_BUDP_NO_DATA      - No closed caption data was found.  As the above
								programming example shows, this is not really
								an error.
	BERR_BUDP_PARSE_ERROR  - Closed caption data was detected, but could not
	                            be successfully parsed.
