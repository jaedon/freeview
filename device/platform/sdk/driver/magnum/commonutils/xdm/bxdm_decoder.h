 * BXDM_Decoder_ReleasePicture_isr could be called multiple times before the next display
 * interrupt event, so the decoder may want to implement a pending released queue that is

 * BXDM_Decoder_GetPictureDropPendingCount_isr returns the total number of fields that are

 * | 1   | 6       | 6       | 0       |

 * | 4   | 6       | 0       | 6       |

 *    4) BXDM_Decoder_GetNextPicture_isr
 *    5) BXDM_Decoder_GetPictureDropPendingCount_isr --> 0
 *
 * XDM knows that 2 fields were dropped before the picture returned in #2 was

 * in #4 was decoded.
