/**************************** Module Overview: *****************************
BDMA module provides porting interface API for higher level software to
control hardware DMA engines. The API exposes hardware functionalities and
hides the hardware and software details. It is targeted for Hydra core based
chip, and is also intended to fit future chips.

There might be multiple memory DMA engines and/or PCI DMA engines in a chip.
A memory DMA engine is used to move data from one location in DRAM to 
another location in DRAM. And a PCI DMA engine is used to move data between
DRAM and any PCI device connected to PCI bus.

Both memory DMA engine and PCI DMA engine are represented as sub-modules of
the BDMA software module.

In order to control a specific hardware DMA engine, higher level software
should first open a BDMA module handle by calling BDMA_Open, and use this
module handle to create a sub-module handle to the DMA engine by calling
either BDMA_Mem_Create2 or BDMA_Pci_Create2. The sub-module handle could 
then be used to setup the DMA engine and perform DMA data transfer using the
sub-module functions. All sub-module functions are prefixed with BDMA_Mem_
or BDMA_Pci_.

User could DMA transfer a list of contiguous blocks in one transfer action. 
In order to do this, user needs to create a transfer handle to represent the
transfer action, then to use it to set block info for each block, to start
the transfer, and finally to get the transfer status. A transfer handle is a
sub-module of a DMA engine.

Two API functions are provided to start a DMA transfer, one for "start" 
only (then the result should be checked actively by user), and another for 
"start and call back" (then the result will be informed by a callback when
the transfer is done).

The "started" transfer might be queued in BDMA first and then be issued to 
hardware in turn.

During a DMA data transfer, both memory and PCI DMA engines could be
programmed to perform translation between little endian and big endian with
either byte aligned swap or short aligned swap. Memory DMA engine could
also perform encryption or decryption. The crypto is set with
BDMA_Mem_Tran_SetCrypto. 

Both memory and PCI DMA engines maintain a current state of engine configure
of swap mode, or max burst size. Each DMA transfer uses the current
configure state.

The transfer handle could be re-used after a DMA transfer is started and
finished, for convenience and better performance. If there is no change to a 
block info, it does not need to be re-set too.

BDMA module is interrupt safe, in the sense that DMA transfer could be 
performed from both interrupt handler or a non-interrupt context such as
user mode process. An exception is that in interrupt handler the completion
of a DMA transfer can not be waited, and therefore call back has to been
used if the "done info" needs to be processed.

In order to support interrupt safety, two sets of transfer API functions are 
provided, one set for non-interrupt context such as user mode process, and 
another set used in interrupt handler or critical session. The second set of
API functions are named with an extra suffix "_isr". 

BDMA is also thread safe. BDMA transfer functions could also be called from
more than one threads.

However, user must ensure that interrupt handler (and its subroutines) and
code in critical session only calls BDMA API functions with suffix "_isr" 
and functions in non-interrupt context only calls BDMA API functions without
that suffix.

And also, if different engine configure are used in different thread or
interrupt handler, higher level software has to use extra mechanism (such
as mutex, but not critical session) to synchronize the API function call in 
order to ensure that the right configure is applied to each DMA transfer.

When a DMA engine sub-module handle or the DMA module handle is no longer
needed, it should be destroyed or closed.

A hardware DMA engine might also be shared by multiple users from both user
mode side and kernel side.

In this case, BDMA API functions should be called independently by each DMA
user to create BDMA_Handle, BDMA_Mem/Pci_Handle, and BDMA_Mem/Pci_Tran_Handle, 
to set block info, and to start a DMA transfer. The result could later be 
polled by the application, or be informed by call-back.

Each user (application) hence runs an independent instance of BDMA as if it 
owns the DMA hardware engine without knowing the sharing issue. Each BDMA 
instance in the system manages its own software context and DMA descriptor
buffer. Only when a transfer is started in hardware, the user provided call
back functions are used to lock the hardware from accessing by other BDMA
instance, and to release it.

Please refer to BDMA_Mem_Handle and BDMA_Pci_Handle and API functions for 
more usage information.

Notes:
------
Before using BDMA, higher level software must connect and enable level 1
interrupt. BDMA automatically creates call back with BINT for level 2
interrupt. Level 1 is left to higher level because it is platform dependent.
The L1 interrupt bit for both memory dma and PCI dma is bit HIF_CPU_INTR in 
register HIF_CPU_INTR1_INTR_W0_STATUS.

Design notes:

	o  The SDRAM address used in our API functions is in memory bus address,
	   rather than virtual address. Virtual address might look more convenient 
	   to user, but using bus address helps to ensure that the DMA transferred 
	   memory block physically exists and is contiguous, and it is very easy 
	   to get the bus address by BMEM_ConvertAddressToOffset if the memory 
	   block is allocated by BMEM_AllocAligned or BMEM_Alloc.
	o  Having user to pass in an array of block info might simplify the
	   process of transferring a list of block (i.e. transfer handle creating, 
	   block info setting, and finally starting), into a single function call. 
	   However, reading data from user provided buffer of indefinite length
	   often causes problem, because the buffer pointer and length can not be 
	   validated before crashing the sub-system. Our current design is more 
	   robust, and it saves the time of copying from user's buffer into 
	   internal DMA description.
	o  Transfer Id is also considered, but we decided to use transfer handle.
	   One difference to the user between transfer Id and handle is that,
	   transfer Id does not need to be explicitly destroyed, but transfer
	   handle does. Therefore transfer handle needs one more API function
	   call for each transfer. However, transfer Id can not be reused,
	   its records disappear automatically, and user can not control it.
	   Another question is that what is the right behavior if the "start"
	   returns an error, such as "invalid parameter" and "engine busy"?
	o  Another implementation option we considered is to have a "done" wait
	   loop in the BDMA module. We finally decided no to because user might 
	   needs to wait longer than what we could have coded and still needs to
	   implement a user's waiting loop.

Summary:
	Function pointer type of user call back functions used to lock and 
	release a hardware DMA engine.

Description:
	The call back functions used in the case that multiple BDMA instances 
	exist in the system. They are coded by the user, and are passed to BDMA 
	when a dma engine sub-module handle is created.

	There are two call-back functions of this type, TryLock and ReleaseLock. 
	
	If multiple BDMA instances exist, before writing dma requests into dma
	(hardware) engine, each BDMA instance needs to check the hardware status 
	and to make sure that the hardware is not in use by another instance. 
	To ensure that the hardware status is not changed in the mean time by 
	another BDMA instance, TryLock is used to lock the hardware before this 
	BDMA instance reads the hardware registers. ReleaseLock is immediately 
	used after the dma requests are written to hardware, or after it is 
	decided that the hardware is still in use by another BDMA instance. If 
	the dma request can not be written into hardware this time, BDMA would 
	try again with result-polling from application, or with a dma-done _isr
	service.

	TryLock should return true if and only if it is successful. The return 
	value from ReleaseLock is not used.

	The lock time is short, and it does not depend on the DMA hardware 
	execution. However, a user mode application could still be preempted 
	after it gets the lock and before it releases it. In this case, a 
	kernel mode dma user could not get the lock and hence dma service until 
	the user mode application resumes execution and releases the lock. In
	the mean time, the hardware engine could indeed have been idle.

	TryLock could increase the user mode application to higher priority so
	that the application will unlikely be preempted. RleaseLock should then
	drop it to its original priority. How high priority the application 
	should be raised to by TryLock? It is up to the application to decide. 

	For a simple implementation, TryLock and ReleaseLock could use a 
	hardware semaphore (such as BCHP_SUN_TOP_CTRL_SEMAPHORE_15). A hardware 
	semaphore is a special register with some simple logic. The simple logic
	ensures that a non-zero value can be successfully written into it if and 
	only if it currently has value "0".

	In TryLock a unique non-zero user-id is written to the semaphore register,
	then the semaphore register value is read back. If the read back value 
	matches the written value (user-id), it means that is has got the 
	semaphore. RelaeseLock could simply write value "0" into the semaphore
	register to release it.

Summary:
	This function opens and initializes the DMA module BDMA.

Description:
	Before any thing could be done to a DMA engine in the chip, a DMA module
	handle, BDMA_Handle, must be opened. From this handle, the sub-module

	This BDMA module handle should eventually be closed by calling BDMA_Close,
	when it is no longer needed.

Input:
	hChip - The chip handle that application created earlier during chip
	initialization sequence. This handle is used for getting chip
	information, chip revision, and miscellaneous chip configurations.

	hRegister - The register handle that application created earlier during
	chip initialization sequence. This handle is used to access chip

/***************************************************************************
Summary:
	Memory DMA engine sub-module handle, or Memory DMA handle for simplicity.

Description:
	This is an opaque handle that represents and controls one HW memory DMA 
	engine. It is needed when the memory DMA engine is configured or used.

	It is created with BDMA_Mem_Create2. 

	The typical process to configure and use a memory DMA engine is as
	follows:

	o Open the DMA module handle.
	o A sub-module handle to the memory DMA engine is created.
	o Configure memory DMA engine (sub-module), such as swapping mode, 
	  and crypto setting.
	o Call BDMA_Mem_Tran_Create2 to create a memory DMA transfer handle.
	o Set the block info (such as source address, destination address, and
	  block size) for each data block to be transferred by calling
	  BDMA_Mem_Tran_SetDmaBlockInfo.
	o Start the transfer by BDMA_Mem_Tran_StartDma, or 
	  BDMA_Mem_Tran_StartDmaAndCallBack.
	o Process the "DMA done" information. Depending on which starting API
	  function was called above, BDMA_Mem_Tran_StartDma or 
	  BDMA_Mem_Tran_StartDmaAndCallBack, the "DMA done" information could 
	  either be acquired by actively calling BDMA_Mem_Tran_GetStatus or
	  be informated by a call back from BDMA.

	There is one engine configure API function BDMA_Mem_SetByteSwapMode for 
	memory DMA sub-module, and one transfer configure API function
	BDMA_Mem_Tran_SetCrypto for memory DMA transfer sub-module. The sub-
	modules maintain a current state of configure. Each setting modifies the 
	current state and is applied to the future calls to 
	BDMA_Mem_Tran_SetDmaBlockInfo. This implies that in a transfer each block 
	could have different engine configure.

	We put current state of crypto setting into transfer, because it is 
	more likely to change from transfer to transfer, but swap mode is not.

	After the engine is configured, user could also perform a DMA transfer 
	in an interrupt handler or critical session, using the API function set 
	named with a "_isr" suffix.

	When a DMA engine sub-module handle is no longer needed, it should be
	destroyed with BDMA_Mem_Destroy.

	Please refer to the DMA module overview for more usage info.

	bytes in a word to send to the byte stream for further operation such 
	as encrypt, and the order of bytes in a word to store into memory.

	The sub-module maintains a current state of read endian and swap mode. 
	Each setting modifies the current state and is applied to the future

/***************************************************************************
Summary:
	Memory DMA Transfer sub-module handle.

Description:
	A memory DMA transfer is a sub-module of the Memory DMA engine (again a
	sub-module of BDMA). BDMA_Mem_Tran_Handle is an opaque handle that holds 
	the context for a memory DMA transfer. It is created by 
	BDMA_Mem_Tran_Create2.

	To perform a transfer with the memory DMA engine (sub-module), a memory 
	DMA transfer handle must be created first, then the transfer handle could
	be used to set block info, to start, and to get the status.

	A transfer typically requests to dma a list of contiguous blocks. Each
	contiguous block is represented by a dma descriptor for hardware. The
	transfer is then described by a list of linked dma descriptors. When 
	"block info" is set for a block, it is set to the corresponding dma
	descriptor.

	A transfer handle could be reused after it is started and finished. It is 
	solely user's responsibility to ensure that each block has the right 
	addresses, swap mode and crypto setting.
	
	A transfer handle has to be explicitly destroyed when it is no longer 
	needed. Otherwise the max limit of the number of active transfer blocks
	would be easily reached, that means new transfer creation would fail.

	Please refer to BDMA_Mem_Handle description and the DMA module overview
	for more usage info.

Summary:
	Set encryption / decryption.

Description:
	During a DMA data transfer, Memory DMA engines could be configured to
	perform encryption or decryption. This API function is used to set the 
	crypto.

	In the case that eCryptMode is BDMA_CryptMode_eNoCrypt, the crypto HW 
	module is disabled and the setting to ulKeySlot has no effect.

	If eCryptMode has other valid value, the crypto HW is enabled and 
	eCryptMode specifies how the crypto treats the transport packet 
	boundaries (refer to BDMA_CryptMode for detail). 

	Further, when scatter-gather SCRAM operation is enabled by bSgEnable, the 
	dma engine will treat the data stream section of a list of dma blocks as a 
	whole for encrypt or decrypt purpose. The stream section starts from the 
	beginning of the block marked as scatter-gather start point, and ends at 
	the end of the block marked as scatter-gather end point. bSgEnable can not 
	change between the scatter-gather start point and end point.

	The rest of the crypto configuration, such as what crypto operation 
	(either encryption or decryption) to perform, what crypto algorithm and 
	what key value to use during crypto operation, was programmed into a key 
	slot with the security module. ulKeySlot selects the key slot to use for
	the crypto. 

	There are 16 key slots in a 7401 chip for the moment. The value (between 
	0 and 15) of ulKeySlot passed to this function must be the same one used 
	in the security module when the key slot was programmed.

	The sub-module maintains a current state of crypt mode and key selection. 
	Each setting modifies the current state and is applied to the future 
	calls to BDMA_Mem_Tran_SetDmaBlockInfo(_isr), unless it is reset again. 
	This implies that in a transfer each block could use different crypto key.

	Application software is responsible to program the selected key slot with
	the security module. If the key slot is not configured well, the dma result 
	is undetermined.

Input:
	hTran - The transfer handle to set crypto.
	BDMA_CryptMode - Crypto mode. If it is BDMA_CryptMode_eNoCrypt, crypto is
	disabled. Otherwise it specifies how transport packet boundary is treated.
	ulKeySlot - Key slot (between 0 and 15) selected for the crypto.

Summary:
	Set the block info for one block of a DMA transfer.

Description:
	Before a dma transfer can be started, block info has to be set for the
	blocks with block index from 0 to (ulNumActBlocks - 1) (ulNumActBlocks 
	is the the number of currently active blocks, passed as a parameter of
	BDMA_Mem_Tran_StartDma or BDMA_Mem_Tran_StartDmaAndCallBack). This API 
	function is used to set block info into HW dma descriptor for one block.

	ulBlockId is the index of the block, in the block list of the transfer
	represented by hTran. It starts from 0.

	The source and destination address are in memory bus address space. They
	are 28 bits unsigned integer number in 7401 chip. It is more likely that 
	they are converted from virtual memory mapped address using 
	BMEM_ConvertAddressToOffset and the virtual address is returned by
	BMEM_AllocAligned or BMEM_Alloc.

	Both addresses and block size are byte aligned. Max block size is
	0xfff,ffff (16 MByte). Source and destination region overlap with 
	(ulSrcBusAddr < ulDstBusAddr < ulSrcBusAddr+ulBlockSize) is not allowed.

	Encryption and decryption algorithms typically work on memory size of 
	multiple 8 bytes or 16 bytes, and certain residue mode, such as residue 
	clear termination or OFB, might be used for the remaining bytes in the 
	block.

	Please notice that when a non-word-aligned source address is used, the
	read endian determine which bytes to read in a 32 bits word.

	The current state of read endian, swap mode maintained in the dma engine,
	and the current state of crypto setting maintained in hTran, are used 
	during the transfer of this block.

	If the Tran is re-used, and there is no change to this block info (
	including the state of read endian ...), there is no need to set info
	for this block again. However, user should pay extra attention to correct 
	the previous setting to scatter-gather start/stop points for each active
	block, unless BDMA_Mem_Tran_Reset/_isr has been used to set them into 
	default values.	

	Please refer to the DMA module overview and BDMA_Mem_Handle for more 
	info on the usage of the memory DMA sub-module API functions.

Input:
	hTran - The transfer handle to set block info.
	ulBlockId - The block index in the block list of this transfer, it starts
	from 0.
	ulDstBusAddr - Destination address in memory bus address space.
	ulSrcBusAddr - Source address in memory bus address space.
	ulBlockSize - This block size in bytes.
	bCryptInit - Whether initialize the encryption / decryption or continue

 * Sub-Module: PCI DMA 
 **************************************************************************/

/***************************************************************************
Summary:
	PCI DMA engine sub-module handle, or PCI DMA handle for simplicity.

Description:
	This is an opaque handle that represents and controls one HW PCI DMA 
	engine. It is needed when the PCI DMA engine is configured or used.

	It is created with BDMA_Pci_Create2. 

	The typical process to configure and use a PCI DMA engine is as
	follows:

	o Open the DMA module handle.
	o A sub-module handle to the PCI DMA engine is created.
	o Configure PCI DMA engine (sub-module), such as swapping mode, max
	  burst size.
	o Call BDMA_Pci_Tran_Create2 to create a PCI DMA transfer handle.
	o Set the block info (such as memory bus address, PCI bus address, 
	  transfer direction, and block size) for each data block to be 
	  transferred by calling BDMA_Pci_Tran_SetBlockInfo.
	o Start the transfer by BDMA_Pci_Tran_StartDma, or 
	  BDMA_Pci_Tran_StartDmaAndCallBack.
	o Process the "DMA done" information. Depending on which starting API
	  function was called above, BDMA_Pci_Tran_StartDma or 
	  BDMA_Pci_Tran_StartDmaAndCallBack, the "DMA done" information could 
	  either be acquired by actively calling BDMA_Pci_Tran_GetStatus, or
	  informed by a call back from BDMA.

	There are two engine configure API functions for PCI DMA sub-module,
	BDMA_Pci_SetSwapMode and BDMA_Pci_SetMaxBurstSize. The sub-module 
	maintains a current state of configure. Each setting modifies current 
	state. Current swap mode is applied when BDMA_Pci_Tran_SetBlockInfo is 
	called in the future, unless it is reset again. This means that in a 
	transfer each block could have different swap mode. But Current max 
	burst size is applied to future calls of BDMA_Pci_Tran_StartDma and
	BDMA_Pci_Tran_StartDmaAndCallBack, that means the blocks of one transfer 
	have to use the same max burst size.

	After the engine is configured, user could also perform a DMA transfer 
	in an interrupt handler or critical session, using the API function set 
	named with an "_isr" suffix.

	When a DMA engine sub-module handle is no longer needed, it should be
	destroyed with BDMA_Pci_Destroy.

	Please refer to the DMA module overview for more usage info.

/***************************************************************************
Summary:
	PCI DMA Transfer sub-module handle.

Description:
	A PCI DMA transfer is a sub-module of the PCI DMA engine (a sub-module of 
	BDMA). BDMA_Pci_Tran_Handle is an opaque handle that holds the context 
	for a PCI DMA transfer. It is created with BDMA_Pci_Tran_Create2.

	To perform a transfer with the PCI DMA engine (sub-module), a PCI DMA 
	transfer handle must be created first, then the transfer handle could be 
	used to set block info, start, and get the status.

	A transfer typically requests to dma a list of contiguous blocks. Each
	contiguous block is represented by a dma descriptor for hardware. The
	transfer is then described by a list of linked dma descriptors. When 
	"block info" is set for a block, it is set to the corresponding dma
	descriptor.

	A transfer handle could be reused after it is started and finished. It is 
	solely user's responsibility to ensure that each block has the right 
	addresses and swap mode, max burst size.
	
	A transfer handle has to be explicitly destroyed when it is no longer 
	needed. Otherwise the max limit of the number of active transfer blocks
	would be easily reached, that means new transfer creation would fail.

	Please refer to BDMA_Pci_Handle description and the DMA module overview
	for more usage info.

Summary:
	Function pointer type of user DMA interrupt call back function.

Description:
	The call back function is coded by the user, is passed to BDMA when a 
	Tran is started with BDMA_Pci_Tran_StartDmaAndCallBack, and is called 
	by BDMA after the Tran is completed, in interrupt hanlder mode, to 
	process the "dma done info.

	It should take three parameters. One is the "user data buffer pointer", 
	passed to the transfer starting API function. It is for user to pass 
	user defined data structure to the call back function, in order to 
	process the "done info". The other two are the transfer handle and 
	eStatus, which are provided by the DMA module and are used to specify 
	which transfer just finished and the transfer status.

Summary:
	Create a transfer handle.

Description:
	This API function is used to create the transfer handle.

	BDMA_Pci_Tran_Create2 takes an input parameter ulNumBlocks, to
	specify the number of contiguous data blocks this transfer is to
	transfer. It should NOT be bigger than ulMaxNumBlocksPerTran in the 
	BDMA_Pci_Settings passed to BDMA_Pci_Create2.

	A transfer handle could be reused after it is started and finished, and
	a transfer handle has to be explicitly destroyed when it is no longer 
	needed.

	When a block info is set with BDMA_Pci_Tran_SetBlockInfo, it is written
	into a descriptor in the memory, and the descriptor is later read by HW.
	Either cached address or non-cached address could be used by BDMA when the
	descriptor is written. A true value for bCachedDesc indicates cached 
	address should be used.

	When cached address is used for the descriptor writting, it will be 
	flushed into memory by BDMA_Pci_Tran_StartDmaAndCallBack or
	BDMA_Pci_Tran_StartDma.

	Please refer to the DMA module overview and BDMA_Pci_Handle for more 
	info on the usage of the PCI DMA sub-module API functions.

Input:
	hPciDma - Sub-module handle to the PCI DMA engine to perform the DMA
	transfer.
	ulNumBlocks - Max number of blocks in this transfer.
	bCachedDesc - Whether use cached address to modify dma descriptor.

Output:
	phTran - The transfer handle created.

Returns:
	BERR_SUCCESS - The transfer handle is created successfully.
	BDMA_ERR_SIZE_OUT_RANGE - ulNumBlocks is 0 or bigger than the allowed.
	BERR_INVALID_PARAMETER - One of the input parameters is invalid.

Summary:
	Set the block info for one block of a DMA transfer.

Description:
	In order to perform a DMA transfer, user first creates a transfer handle,
	then uses it to set block info for each block, to start the DMA transfer, 
	and finally to get the transfer status. This API function is used to set 
	block info into HW dma descriptor for one block. 
	
	ulBlockId is the index of the block, in the block list of the transfer
	represented by hTran. It starts from 0.

	The PCI address is in the PCI bus address space. It is a 32 bits unsigned
	integer number. And the memory address is the memory bus address space.
	It is a 28 bits number.

	It is more likely that the memory address is converted from virtual 
	memory mapped address using BMEM_ConvertAddressToOffset and the virtual 
	address is returned by BMEM_AllocAligned or BMEM_Alloc.

	eTranDirection is to specify whether the transfer of this block is from 
	SDRAM to a PCI device or another way around.

	Both addresses and block size must be 32-bit aligned. Max block size is 
	0xfff,ffff (16 MByte), and minimum block size is 0x4.

	The current state of swap mode is used during the transfer of this block.

	If the Tran is re-used, and there is no change to this block info (
	including the state of read endian ...), there is no need to set info
	for this block again.

	Please refer to the DMA module overview and BDMA_Pci_Handle for more info
	on the usage of the PCI sub-module API functions.

Input:
	hTran - The transfer handle to set block info.
	ulBlockId - The block index in the block list of this transfer.
	ulMemBusAddr - Memory address in memory bus address space.
	ulPciBusAddr - PCI address in PCI bus address space.
	ulBlockSize - This block size in bytes.
	eTranDirection - Transfer direction of this block.

Output:

Returns:
	BERR_SUCCESS - The block info is set successfully.
	BDMA_ERR_OVERLAP - Source and destination region overlap.
	BDMA_ERR_NOT_WORD_ALIGNED - ulSrcBusAddr, ulDstBusAddr, or ulBlockSize
	is not 32-bit aligned.
	BDMA_ERR_SIZE_OUT_RANGE - ulBlockSize is bigger than 16 MByte.
	BERR_INVALID_PARAMETER - One of the input parameters is invalid.

Summary:
	Start a DMA transfer.

Description:
	This API function is used to start a DMA transfer.

	BDMA_Pci_Tran_StartDma takes, as an input parameter, hTran to specify the 
	transfer to start. 

	As starting a transfer with this API function, user needs to implement a 
	status checking and sleeping loop, to wait for the completion of the
	DMA transfer, and then to process the "done" info.

	The current state of max burst size is used during the transfer.

	Before a dma transfer can be started, block info has to be set with
	BDMA_Pci_Tran_SetBlockInfo for all blocks with block index from 0 to 
	(ulNumActBlocks - 1). ulNumActBlocks should be bigger than 0, and less 
	than or equal to ulNumBlocks passed to BDMA_Pci_Tran_Create2.

	If cached address is used for the descriptor writting, it will be 
	flushed into memory inside BDMA_Pci_Tran_StartDma.

	when the dma hardware engine is shared by multiple BDMA instances, the 
	transfer might be queued into software until the hardware is no longer in 
	use by another BDMA instance. User provided lock call back functions are 
	used to ensure atomic access to the hardware dma engine.

	Please refer to the DMA module overview and BDMA_Pci_Handle for more 
	info on the usage of the PCI DMA sub-module API functions.

Input:
	hTran - The transfer handle to start.
	ulNumActBlocks - Block with index from 0 to (ulNumActBlocks - 1) will be
	dma transfered with this start call.

Output:

Returns:

Description:
	This API function is used to start a DMA transfer, and to register a call 
	back function to be called when the transfer finishes. This API function
	can be used only if "true" is set to bSupportCallBack in the struct
	BDMA_Pci_Settings passed to BDMA_Pci_Create2, otherwise error is returned.

	It takes, as input parameters, hTran to specify the transfer to start,
	a call back function pointer, and a user data buffer pointer. Then the 
	call back function will be called by the "DMA done" interrupt handler
	of the module, when the transfer finishes.

	parameters. One is the "user data buffer pointer", passed to this API
	function. It is for user to pass user defined data structure to the call 
	back function, in order to process the "done info". Another two are 
	transfer handle hTran and eStatus, which are provided by the DMA module 
	and are used to specify which transfer just finished and its status. 

	The current state of max burst size is used during the transfer.

	Before a dma transfer can be started, block info has to be set with
	BDMA_Pci_Tran_SetBlockInfo for all blocks with block index from 0 to

Summary:
	Set encryption / decryption.

Description:
	This API function is replaced by BDMA_Mem_Tran_SetCrypto and will be 
	obsolete in the future. New code should use the new one and stop using 
	this API function.

	During a DMA data transfer, Memory DMA engines could be configured to
	perform encryption or decryption. This API function is used to set the 
	crypto.

	In the case that eCryptMode is BDMA_CryptMode_eNoCrypt, the crypto HW 
	module is disabled and the setting to ulKeySlot has no effect.

	If eCryptMode has other valid value, the crypto HW is enabled and 
	eCryptMode specifies how the crypto treats the transport packet 
	boundaries (refer to BDMA_CryptMode for detail). 

	Further, when scatter-gather SCRAM operation is enabled by bSgEnable, the 
	dma engine will treat the data stream section of a list of dma blocks as a 
	whole for encrypt or decrypt purpose. The stream section starts from the 
	beginning of the block marked as scatter-gather start point, and ends at 
	the end of the block marked as scatter-gather end point. bSgEnable can not 
	change between the scatter-gather start point and end point.

	The rest of the crypto configuration, such as what crypto operation 
	(either encryption or decryption) to perform, what crypto algorithm and 
	what key value to use during crypto operation, was programmed into a key 
	slot with the security module. ulKeySlot selects the key slot to use for
	the crypto. 

	There are 16 key slots in a 7401 chip for the moment. The value (between 
	0 and 15) of ulKeySlot passed to this function must be the same one used 
	in the security module when the key slot was programmed.

	The sub-module maintains a current state of crypt mode and key selection. 
	Each setting modifies the current state and is applied to the future 
	calls to BDMA_Mem_Tran_SetDmaBlockInfo(_isr), unless it is reset again. 
	This implies that in a transfer each block could use different crypto key.

	Application software is responsible to program the selected key slot with
	the security module. If the key slot is not configured well, the dma result 
	is undetermined.

Input:
	hMemDma - Sub-module handle to the memory DMA engine to modify.
	BDMA_CryptMode - Crypto mode. If it is BDMA_CryptMode_eNoCrypt, crypto is
	disabled. Otherwise it specifies how transport packet boundary is treated.

	parameters. One is the "user data buffer pointer", passed to this API
	function. It is for user to pass user defined data structure to the call 
	back function, in order to process the "done info". Another two are 
	transfer handle hTran and eStatus, which are provided by the DMA module 
	and are used to specify which transfer just finished and its status. 
	Notice that as asynchronous call back is used, it is possible to queue 
	several transfers in PCI DMA engine.

	The current state of max burst size is used during the transfer.

	Please refer to the DMA module overview and BDMA_Pci_Handle for more 
	info on the usage of the PCI DMA sub-module API functions.

Input:
	hTran - The transfer handle to start.
	pDoneCallBack_isr - Call back function used when the transfer finishes.
	pUserCallBackParam - User's data passed to the call back function.

Output:

Returns:
	BERR_SUCCESS - Transfer starting request is accepted.
	BDMA_ERR_BLOCK_INFO_NOT_SET - A block info has not been set.

Description:
	During a DMA data transfer, sharf memory DMA engines could be configured 
	to perform different kind of SCRAM operations.

	In the case that eSharfMode is BDMA_SharfMode_ePassThrough, the data will
	pass through sharf without SCRAM operation.

	If eSharfMode has other valid value, the specified SCRAM is performed by
	sharf HW.

	Further, when scatter-gather mode is enabled by bSgEnable, the dma engine 
	will treat the data stream section of a list of dma blocks as a whole for 
	SCRAM purpose. The stream section starts from the beginning of the block 
	marked as scatter-gather start point, and ends at the end of the block 
	marked as scatter-gather end point. bSgEnable and eSharfMode can not 
	change between the scatter-gather start point and end point.

	When bUseBspKey is false, sharf uses the key wrapped in the head of the 
	scatter-gather data stream section, for the following data encrypt or
	decrypt. if bUseBspKey is true, sharf uses the key supplied by Aegis 
	directly for data encrypt and decrypt, regardless of the state of key-
	present set with BDMA_Mem_Sharf_Tran_SetSgStartEnd.

	The sub-module maintains a current state of settings by this API function.
	Each setting modifies the current state and is applied to the future 
	calls to BDMA_Mem_Tran_SetDmaBlockInfo(_isr), unless it is reset again. 

Input:
	hTran - The transfer handle to set crypto.
	BDMA_SharfMode - SCRAM operation mode.
	bSgEnable - Whether enable scatter-gather SCRAM operation.
	bUseBspKey - If it is true, sharf uses the key supplied by Aegis directly 
	(regardless of what BDMA_Mem_Sharf_Tran_SetSgStartEnd sets for key-present).

Summary:
	Set the block info for one block of a DMA transfer.

Description:
	In order to perform a DMA transfer, user first creates a transfer handle,
	then uses it to set block info for each block, to start the DMA transfer, 
	and finally to get the transfer status. This API function is used to set 
	block info for one block. 

	ulBlockId is the index of the block, in the block list of the transfer
	represented by hTran. It starts from 0. eContext is the context number
	this block belongs to.

	The source and destination address are in memory bus address space. They
	are 28 bits unsigned integer number in 7038 chip. It is more likely that 
	they are converted from virtual memory mapped address using 
	BMEM_ConvertAddressToOffset and the virtual address is returned by
	BMEM_AllocAligned or BMEM_Alloc.

	Both addresses and block size are byte aligned. Max block size is
	0xfff,ffff (16 MByte). Source and destination region overlap with 
	(ulSrcBusAddr < ulDstBusAddr < ulSrcBusAddr+ulBlockSize) is not allowed.

	Encryption and decryption algorithms typically work on memory size of 
	multiple 8 bytes or 16 bytes, and certain residue mode clear termination 
	or OFB, might be used for the remaining bytes in the block.

	Please notice that when a non-word-aligned source address is used, the
	read endian determine which bytes to read in a 32 bits word.

	The current state of read endian, swap mode and encrypt / decrypt setting 
	is used during the transfer of this block.

	Please refer to the DMA module overview and BDMA_Mem_Handle for more 
	info on the usage of the memory DMA sub-module API functions.

Input:
	hTran - The transfer handle to set block info.
	ulBlockId - The block index in the block list of this transfer, it starts
	from 0.
	eContext - The context number this block belongs to.
	ulDstBusAddr - Destination address in memory bus address space.
	ulSrcBusAddr - Source address in memory bus address space.
