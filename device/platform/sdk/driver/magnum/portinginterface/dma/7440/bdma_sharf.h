/**************************** Module Overview: *****************************
SHARF memory dma engine is also represented by regular memory dma sub-module
handle BDMA_Mem_Handle. The API functions and usage are exactly the same as
regular memory dma, except that

	o  Its BDMA_Mem_Handle sub-module handle should be created by
	   BDMA_Mem_Sharf_Create, rather than BDMA_Mem_Create; should be destoyed
	   by BDMA_Mem_Sharf_Destroy, rahtern than BDMA_Mem_Destroy.
	o  BDMA_Mem_Sharf_Tran_SetCrypto should be used to configure the sharf SCRAM
	   operations, and BDMA_Mem_SetCrypto should not be used for sharf dma.
	o  BDMA_Mem_Sharf_Tran_SetSgStartEnd should be used to set the start
	   point and/or end point of scatter-gather SCRAM.
	o  BDMA_Mem_Sharf_Tran_SetDmaBlockInfo(_isr) are used to replace the 
	   regular BDMA_Mem_Tran_SetDmaBlockInfo(_isr).

bdma_sharf.h could be considered as part of bdma.h for sharf particularly.

/***************************************************************************
Summary:
	Set sharf scram operation.

Description:
	During a DMA data transfer, sharf memory DMA engines could be configured 
	to perform different kind of SCRAM operations.

	In the case that eSharfMode is BDMA_SharfMode_ePassThrough, the data will
	pass through sharf without SCRAM operation.

	If eSharfMode has other valid value, the specified SCRAM is performed by
	sharf HW.

	Further, when scatter-gather mode is enabled by bSgEnable, the dma engine 
	will treat the data stream section of a list of dma blocks as a whole for 
	SCRAM purpose. The stream section starts from the beginning of the block 
	marked as scatter-gather start point, and ends at the end of the block 
	marked as scatter-gather end point. bSgEnable and eSharfMode can not 
	change between the scatter-gather start point and end point.

	When bUseBspKey is false, sharf uses the key wrapped in the head of the 
	scatter-gather data stream section, for the following data encrypt or
	decrypt. if bUseBspKey is true, sharf uses the key supplied by Aegis 
	directly for data encrypt and decrypt, regardless of the state of key-
	present set with BDMA_Mem_Sharf_Tran_SetSgStartEnd.

	The sub-module maintains a current state of settings by this API function.
	Each setting modifies the current state and is applied to the future 
	calls to BDMA_Mem_Tran_SetDmaBlockInfo(_isr), unless it is reset again. 

Input:
	hTran - The transfer handle to set crypto.
	BDMA_SharfMode - SCRAM operation mode.
	bSgEnable - Whether enable scatter-gather SCRAM operation.
	bUseBspKey - If it is true, sharf uses the key supplied by Aegis directly 
	(regardless of what BDMA_Mem_Sharf_Tran_SetSgStartEnd sets for key-present).
	bCmp8LstByts - If it is true, sharf will use only the 8 least significant 
	bytes for digest comparing.
Output:

Returns:
	BERR_SUCCESS - crypto setting is set successfully.
	BERR_INVALID_PARAMETER - One of the input parameters is invalid.

Summary:

Description:
	When SCRAM operation and scatter-gather mode are enabled, the sharf dma

	whole for SCRAM purpose. The stream section starts from the beginning of 
	the block marked as scatter-gather start point, and ends at the end of 
	the block marked as scatter-gather end point.

	This API function is used to mark the block with ID ulBlockId as scatter-
	gather start and/or end point. It can also mark whether crypto key and/or
	digest/MAC reference value is prepended into the data transferred by dma.

Input:
	hTran - The transfer handle to set block info.
	ulBlockId - The block index in the block list of this transfer, it starts

/***************************************************************************
Summary:
	Set the block info for one block of a DMA transfer.

Description:
	In order to perform a DMA transfer, user first creates a transfer handle,
	then uses it to set block info for each block, to start the DMA transfer, 
	and finally to get the transfer status. This API function is used to set 
	block info for one block. 

	ulBlockId is the index of the block, in the block list of the transfer
	represented by hTran. It starts from 0. eContext is the context number
	this block belongs to.

	The source and destination address are in memory bus address space. They
	are 28 bits unsigned integer number in 7038 chip. It is more likely that 
	they are converted from virtual memory mapped address using 
	BMEM_ConvertAddressToOffset and the virtual address is returned by
	BMEM_AllocAligned or BMEM_Alloc.

	Both addresses and block size are byte aligned. Max block size is
	0xfff,ffff (16 MByte). Source and destination region overlap with 
	(ulSrcBusAddr < ulDstBusAddr < ulSrcBusAddr+ulBlockSize) is not allowed.

	Encryption and decryption algorithms typically work on memory size of 
	multiple 8 bytes or 16 bytes, and certain residue mode clear termination 
	or OFB, might be used for the remaining bytes in the block.

	Please notice that when a non-word-aligned source address is used, the
	read endian determine which bytes to read in a 32 bits word.

	The current state of read endian, swap mode and encrypt / decrypt setting 
	is used during the transfer of this block.

	Please refer to the DMA module overview and BDMA_Mem_Handle for more 
	info on the usage of the memory DMA sub-module API functions.

Input:
	hTran - The transfer handle to set block info.
	ulBlockId - The block index in the block list of this transfer, it starts
	from 0.
	eContext - The context number this block belongs to.
	ulDstBusAddr - Destination address in memory bus address space.
	ulSrcBusAddr - Source address in memory bus address space.
	ulBlockSize - This block size in bytes.

Output:

Returns:
	BERR_SUCCESS - The block info is set successfully.
	BDMA_ERR_OVERLAP - Source and destination region overlap.
	BDMA_ERR_SIZE_OUT_RANGE - ulBlockSize is 0 or bigger than 16 MByte.
	BERR_INVALID_PARAMETER - One of the input parameters is invalid.
