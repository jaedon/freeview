bhsm_otpmsp.c, bhsm_otpmsp.h, bhsm_crc.c, Makefile.crc, crc/bhsm_crc.h are 
encrypted with CryptoGram key "Aegis OTP Key". 

If they're needed in the build, please 
- get the corresponding GPG key from Chin or Bryant to decrypt them first.  
- add one more option "BHSM_OTPMSP=ON" on the make command line
