All the files in this directory or the subdirectories are 
 
encrypted with CryptoGram key "Aegis IP Licensing Key".

If they're needed in the build, please 
- get the corresponding GPG key from Chin or Bryant to decrypt them first.  
- add one more option "BHSM_IP_LICENSING=ON" on the make command line
