Summary:
This function returns a recommended default settings for HSM module.

Description:
This function shall return a recommended default settings for HSM module.
This function shall be called before BHSM_Open
and the caller can then over-ride any of the default settings 
required for the build and configuration by calling BHSM_Open.

These default settings are always the same regardless of how 
many times this function is called or what other functions have 
been called in the porting interface. 


Calling Context:
The function shall be called from application level (for example in 
VxWorks or no-os) or from driver level (for example in Linux,
recommended ioctl: BHSM_IOCTL_GET_DEFAULT_SETTINGS)

Performance and Timing:
This is a synchronous function that will return when it is done.

Input:
in_chipHandle - BCHP_Handle,  chip handle.

Output:
outp_sSettings - BHSM_Settings, a ref/pointer to the default setting.

Summary:
This function creates the Host Secure Module handle.

Description:
This function shall create the Host Secure module handle.
It also initializes the Host Secure module 
and hardware using settings stored in the outp_sSettings pointer.
All the associated channels are not ready to be access until
BHSM_ChannelOpen is called and returns successfully.
 
The caller can pass a NULL pointer for inp_sSettings. If the 
p_Settings pointer is NULL, default settings should be used.

It is the caller responsibility to store the outp_handle and uses
it for the future function call after this function returns
successfully.

Before calling this function, the only function that the caller 
can call is BHSM_GetDefaultSettings. System shall not call
any other Host Secure functions prior to this function.

System shall not call this function more than once without calling BHSM_Close
previously.

If illegal settings are passed in an error should be 
returned and the hardware state should not be modified. 

The BINT_Handle is only required if this module needs to 
associate ISR callback routines with L2 interrupts. 


Calling Context:
The function shall be called from application level (for example in 
VxWorks or no-os) or from driver level (for example in Linux,
during insmod )

Performance and Timing:
This is a synchronous function that will return when it is done.

Input:

in_chipHandle - BCHP_Handle,  Chip handle.
in_interruptHandle - BINT_Handle, Interrupt handle to handle Host Secure interrupt.
in_xptHandle -	BXPT_Handle, Transport handle.
inp_sSettings - BHSM_Settings, the settings that apply to multiple
				channels.  If NULL, a default setting shall be used.
