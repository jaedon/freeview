/*****************************************************************************
Summary:

This function is provided for MIPS host to use the PKE RSA engine inside BSP to do RSA Public key based verification(decryption), 
RSA private key based signing (encryption). RSA cryptographic functionality could be disabled via setting specific MSP bits.
Since the performance is not very fast, may not be widely used.

Though this function can be used to do RSA encryprtion using public key and RSA decryption using private key, it's rarely 
used this way due to its very slow processing speed compared to other regular (de)encryption algorithms. 

Description:

The given data block in one function call can be a first piece, middle piece, last piece of a big message or a complete message.
( the way to hold data using a fixed buffer may be replaced with a data pointer later)

The passthrough mode (0xFF) is mainly for testing purpose, contact Broadcom for details if it's really needed. Normal mode (0) uses 
(c^e mode n) formula. Chinese Remainder Theorem (1) mode TBD.

Each member of public key set (n, e) or private key set (p, q, d) can be as long as 2048bits=256bytes.


Calling Context:

This function can be called any time after the system and BSP is initialized, when the applications decides to utilize the 
PKE RSA engine inside BSP.


Performance and Timing:
This is a synchronous/blocking function that won'tl return until it is done or failed.  No testing data is available, and no  
estimated time either. Here's one for the reference.

	'unInputDataLen' to state the actual length of message data piece to BSP
	'aucInputData'  to provide a message data piece or a whole message to do the PKE verification or signing
	
	the output section can be any value (normally input as 0).
			
Output:
inoutp_userDesAesIO  - BHSM_UserDesAesIO_t, the member in output section

	'unStatus' is modified to reflect the command processing status at BSP side, 0 for success, non-zero for certain error.
	'unOutputDataLen' is 16 bit value, in bits, the length of returned cleartext or ciphertext

Summary:

This function is provided for MIPS host to use the DES, AES engine inside BSP to "accelarate" DES/AES processing. 
Since the performance is not very fast, may not be widely used.

Description:

The given data block in one function call can be a first piece, middle piece, last piece of a big message or a complete message.
( the way to hold data using a fixed buffer may be replaced with a data pointer later)

So far, only clear key support is available ( later, may add the secure key support reusing keyladder operation).

The supported algorithm includes DES_ECB, 3DES_ECB, AES128_ECB for this time. Actually it's very convenient to add 
the support of many more algorithms, and will be added when the requirement emerges.

Calling Context:

This function can be called any time after the system and BSP is initialized, when the applications decides to utilize the 
crypto engine inside BSP.


Performance and Timing:
This is a synchronous/blocking function that won'tl return until it is done or failed.  


Input:
in_handle  - BHSM_Handle, Host Secure module handle.
inoutp_userDesAesIO  - BHSM_UserDesAesIO_t, all members in the input section are always needed,
	'auKeyData' is always needed to provide the clear key, populated from the array top if not fully occupied
	'ucAlgorithm'  to pick up a BSP algorithm, DES_ECB/0, 3DESABA_ECB/1, AES128_ECB/2 			
	'ucOprMode'  to select  decryption or encryption processing at BSP
	'unInputDataLen' to state the actual length of message data piece to BSP, has to be padded depending on 'ucAlgorithm' choice 
	'aucInputData'  to provide a message data piece or a whole message
	
	the output section can be any value (normally input as 0).
			
Output:
inoutp_userDesAesIO  - BHSM_UserDesAesIO_t, the member in output section

	'unStatus' is modified to reflect the command processing status at BSP side, 0 for success, non-zero for certain error.
	'unOutputDataLen' is the length in bytes of returned encrypted or decrypted message data
	'aucOutputData' contains the returned encrypted or decrypted message data

/*****************************************************************************
Summary:

This function is to calculate out a digial digest for a given message, using SHA1 or HMAC with clear key or HMAC with secure key. 

Description:

The given message can be of any length as long as the memory operation is succesful. The supported clear key is 20 bytes in length though 
the max key length can be 64 bytes theorically. The supported secure key to be generated can be 64/128/192 bits in length (normally use 128 bits). 
The output digest is 20 bytes always for any SHA1 or HMAC operation.

SHA1 operation need no any key. HMAC clear key operation need a provided key and message data in a same function call. HMAC secure key operation 
need a preceding Keyladder1 operation to generate a key5 ( via calling BHSM_GenerateRouteKey function three times, provided 3 sets of key seed/procin),
when the Key5 of KeyLadder1 is ready, call this BHSM_UserHmacSha1 function to provide the message data to BSP.


Calling Context:

- this function with SHA1 operation can be called any time after the system and BSP is initialized.
- this function with HMAC-with-clear-key can be called any time after the system and BSP is initialized.
- this function with HMAC-with-secure-key can only be called after a successful Keyladder1 operation to generate a valid Key5.
(of course the system and BSP had been initialized.)


Performance and Timing:
This is a synchronous/blocking function that won'tl return until it is done or failed.  Some bench test shows
        -  HMAC,  key=20 bytes, data =187 bytes, time =2369 us, rate =93500 Bps
        -  HMAC,  key=20 bytes, data =48128 bytes, time =339965 us, rate =141970 Bps
        -  SHA1,  no key,    data =1024 bytes, time =8376 us, rate =128000 Bps
        -  SHA1,  no key,    data =32768 bytes, time =231412 us, rate =141852 Bps


Input:
in_handle  - BHSM_Handle, Host Secure module handle.
inoutp_userHmacSha1IO  - BHSM_UserHmacSha1IO_t, in the input section
	'oprMode' is always needed to select digest calculation mode,SHA1/0, HMAC-clear-key/1, HMAC-secure-key/2, others invalid
	      Keyladder1 operation to generate Key5 is mandatory in advance if to select HAMC-secure-key
	'contextSwitch' is always needed to pick up a BSP internal context to use:0x0c~0x0F only, others invalid.			
	'keyData' is only needed for HMAC-clear-key/1 as selected in the 1st member
	'unInputDataLen' is always needed to state the actual length of message data for digest calculation
	'pucInputData' is always needed to provide the message. If not the last piece of message data, must be multiple of 64bytes.
	
	the output section can be any value (normally input as 0).
			
Output:
inoutp_userHmacSha1IO  - BHSM_UserHmacSha1IO_t, the member 'unStatus' in output section will be modified 
to reflect the command processing status at BSP side, 0 for success, non-zero for certain error.

	'aucOutputData' contains the returned digest, 20 bytes of big endian byte array.

Returns:
BERR_SUCCESS - success
BHSM_STATUS_FAILED - failure

/*****************************************************************************
Summary:

This function is to cancel an ongoing processing inside BSP as requested by MIPS previously. Now some high prority application 
wants to cancel it so that new request(s) can be sent to BSP for handling.

Description:

This command is sent to BSP on a higher priority command buffer (or interface channel). Mostly it should return successfully in any case. 
The cancelled action was sent to BSP via a regular priority command buffer. An example of such cancelled action could be a lengthy message 
digest calculation.

Calling Context:

This function is called when a previous request to BSP has being processed for a pretty long time, still no return or a higher 
priority application wants to use BSP to do something urgent.

Performance and Timing:
This is a synchronous/blocking function that won'tl return until it is done or failed. No testing data is available, and no  
estimated time either.

Input:
in_handle  - BHSM_Handle, Host Secure module handle.
inoutp_cancelCmdIO  - BHSM_CancelCmdIO_t, no any specific parameters are needed in input section.
					the output section can be any value (normally input as 0).
			
Output:
inoutp_cancelCmdIO  - BHSM_CancelCmdIO_t, the member 'unStatus' in output section will be modified 
to reflect the command processing status at BSP side, 0 for success, non-zero for certain error.

Returns:
BERR_SUCCESS - success
BHSM_STATUS_FAILED - failure
