/* 
 * "Self-describing" firmware header 
 *
 * This structure contains the information necessary for the Aegis processor
 * to initiate the loading and execution of the AVD firmware. The members of
 * the structure correspond to the following map of the firmware after being
 * restructured and relocated by the SVP relocation utility:
 * 
 *    +------------+ -> uiRelocationBase and outerCode.uiAddr
 *    | Outer Loop |
 *    |    Code    |
 *    +------------+ -> outerCode.uiAddr + outerCode.uiSize (end of OUTER code)
 *   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *    +------------+ -> innerCode.uiAddr
 *    | Inner Loop |
 *    |    Code    |
 *    +------------+ -> innerCode.uiAddr + innerCode.uiSize (end of INNER code)
 *   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *    +------------+ -> signature.uiAddr
 *    | Signature  | 
 *    +------------+ -> signature.uiAddr + signature.uiSize
 *   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *    +------------+ -> outerData.uiAddr
 *    | Outer Loop |
 *    |    Data    |
 *    +------------+
 *    | Outer Loop |
 *    |     BSS    |
 *    +------------+ -> outerData.uiAddr + outerData.uiSize
 *   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *    +------------+ -> innerData.uiAddr
 *    | Inner Loop |
 *    |    Data    |
 *    +------------+
 *    | Inner Loop |
 *    |     BSS    |
 *    +------------+ -> innerData.uiAddr + innerData.uiSize
 *
 * ol_code_size, ol_data_size, il_code_size and il_data_size are values that
 * are known to the MetaWare linker but not included in the FW image. These
 * values could be provided by the firmware team or calculated by the SVP
 * relocation utility, but this would yield a value considerably smaller than
 * that given to the linker.
 * 
 * signature_size is an optional argument passed to the SVP relocation utility.
 * If the size is not specified to the utility, it defaults to 0 and the
 * signature_addr member is set to NULL. This means that the signature is
 * external to the firmware and that its location and size must be managed by
 * the application that created it. The signature_addr, if it is non-NULL
 * will always be equal to il_end_of_code.
 *
 * cmd_buffer_addr is the first 128 bytes of the outer loop data section. This
 * is equal to il_end_of_code or, if signature size is non-zero, il_end_of_code
 * + signature_size.
