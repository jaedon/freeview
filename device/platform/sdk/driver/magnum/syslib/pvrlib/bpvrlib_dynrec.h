/*================== Module Overview =====================================

This module implements the record functionality for pvr using a list
of complete, free, and hardware buffers.  Free buffers can be shared between
all record channels in order to handle peaks in bandwidth (since it is
less likely that all record channels will peak at the same time).  This
allows more efficient memory utilization than having static buffers for
each channel.

It is only possible to include either the standard ring buffer based record
or this dynamic implementation (which is why they share the same API).

The following general overview describes the record algorithm:

 0.0 Master Handle Creation
   - A master record handle is created (it is then used for subsequent record
     channel open calls)
   - Size of entire record buffer is passed as parameter (same for all record channels)
   
 1.0 Open
   - Resources (events, lists, etc) are created.
 
 1.1 Configure Record
   - These should be performed outside the record syslib
   - Data transport PIDs are enabled and configured
   - Record parameters are configured (including decryption/encryption, etc)
   - Record pid channel bitmap is enabled
   - SCT record parameters should be set
 
 1.2 Start Record (SCT record channel should be started first if required)
   - Free buffers are added to record hardware and hardware list
   - Record hardware is started
 
 1.3 Get Data (not re-entrant for same record channel)
   - Record buffer address and size is obtained from buffer complete list
   (this step may block if there is no data available)
   (blocking is disabled if the record channel is stopped)
   - Data is copied to specified buffer
   - Buffer complete list is updated (descriptor is added to free list)
   - The amount of data copied from record channel is returned
   - Overflow status is returned
 
 (Alternate to 1.3)
 1.3.1 Request to Get Data (steps 1.3.x not re-entrant for same record channel)
   - Record buffer address and size is obtained from buffer complete list
   (this step may block if there is no space available)
   (blocking is disabled if the record channel is stopped)
   - Overflow status is returned
 
 1.3.2 Data is copied from specified buffer by calling code
 
 1.3.3 Complete list is updated
   - Buffer complete list is updated (descriptor is added to free list)
 
 1.4 Descriptor complete ISR()
   - First descriptor is removed from hardware list and checked for completion
   - If complete, descriptor is added to complete list
   - Check if next descriptor has also completed (repeat process if necessary)
   - Set event to notify of data arrival
 
 1.5 Stop Record
   - Record hardware is stopped
   - Wait for record done interrupt to occur if we are stopping a transport record channel
   - Partially complete descriptor is moved to complete list (with special flag
     specifying how much of the buffer is occupied)
   - All left over descriptors are moved from hw to the free list
   - Any blocking calls are released (future calls are not allowed to block)
   - Additional get data function call should be called to get remaining
	  data from record.
 
 1.6 Free
   - Free descriptor buffer
   - Free record buffer manager
