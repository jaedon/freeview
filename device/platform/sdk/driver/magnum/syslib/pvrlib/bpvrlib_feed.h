/************************************************************************
The BPVRlib_Feed is replacement for BPVRlib_Play. And goal of this
replacement is to improve performance, it's done in several ways: 
	o reduce code complexity by removing unused functionality
	o support for batch operations (send multiple blocks at the time), thus spreading cost of function call across multiple data chunks 
	o effective use of cached memory to reduce latency of CPU to hardware communications.


Purpose of BPVRlib_Feed library is to send data from the memory using the playback block into the transport hardware.

BPVRlib_Feed library provides scalable API that could be used in wide range of application 
	o data from circular FIFO 
	o data from network buffers 
	o synchronous transfer from the user's memory 
	o data from the stream parsers library 
	o good use of resources at hand (MIPS cache, scatter/gather nature of playback hardware) 
	o Asynchronous/non-blocking execution
