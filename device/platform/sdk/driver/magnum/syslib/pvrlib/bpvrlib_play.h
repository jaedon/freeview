 * Module Description:
 *
 * This module implements the playback functionality for pvr using an intermediate
 * ring buffer.  It features a programmable buffer location, buffer size, and number
 * of descriptors.  It also supports a constant stream by dynamically adding buffers

 /*================== Module Overview =====================================
 
 The following general overview describes the playback algorithm:
  
  1.0 Allocate
  
	- The number of descriptors and buffer address are passed as parameters
	- The ring buffer manager is allocated
	- Array of descriptors is allocated (all descriptors are added to free list)
  
  1.1 Start Playback
  
	- Playback resync variable is set (used to reset sync detect engine)
	- Configure playback hardware based upon sync mode
	- Playback hardware is started
  
  1.2 Add Data (not re-entrant for same playback channel)
  
	- Buffer address and size is requested from the ring buffer manager
	(this step may block if there is no space available)
	- Data is copied into specified buffer
	- Ring buffer write offset is updated
	- Data is commited to hardware
	- In the case of no blocking, the amount of data NOT copied is returned
  
  (Alternate 1.2)
  1.2.1 Request to Add Data (steps 1.2.x not re-entrant for same playback channel)
  
	- Free buffer address and size is requested from the ring buffer manager
	(this step may block if there is no space available)
  
  1.2.2 Data is copied to specified buffer by calling code
  
  1.2.3 Write pointer is updated
  
	- Ring buffer write offset is updated
	- Data is commited to hardware
  
  1.3 Data is Commited To Hardware
  
	- Availability of free descriptor is checked
	(this step may block if there is no space available)
	- Descriptor is obtained from the free list
	- Buffer address and size is programmed into descriptor
	- Descriptor is added to hardware list
	- Descriptor is programmed into playback hardware
  
  1.4 Hardware Data Complete
  
	- First descriptor is removed from hardware list
	- Event is triggered signaling removal of descriptor
	- Ring buffer read offset is updated
	- Event is triggered signaling freeing of data from ring buffer
	- Descriptor is added to free list
	- Check if next descriptor has also completed (repeat process if necessary)
  
  1.5 Stop Playback
  
	- Playback hardware is stopped
	- Ring buffer manager is reset
	- All descriptors are moved from hw to the free list
  
  1.6 Free
  
	- Free descriptor buffer
	- Free ring buffer manager

/***********************************************************/ /**
Summary:
This function is an alternate way of adding data to a playback channel
on a buffer by buffer basis.  This allows scatter gather playback
to be accomplished by loading specified buffers directly into the playback
channel.

Description:
The calling code needs to track the number of buffers 
added to playback and use the BPVRlib_Play_IsBufferComplete() function
to determine when buffers have been completed.  Alternatively,
the numScatGatDesc stat obtained by the BPVRlib_Play_GetStats() 
function can be used to detect when buffers have completed.

Buffers added using this function will be directly accessed by the
playback hardware.  Therefore, buffers must be contiguous and be
covertable using the BMEM_ConvertAddressToOffset() function.  
This function will not flush the CPU cache (or any other cache
in the system) so if necessary this should be done before calling
this function. The calling function cannot reuse the specified 
buffer until playback is done using it.

This function can be called and used at the same time the ring
buffer is being used.  The data will be queued up in the order
that the various functions were called.

This function requires all data added to the ring buffer to be
committed to hardware and requires a free descriptor to be
available.  The block parameter can be used to wait for these
requirements to be satisfied before the function returns.

	const size_t bfrSize,	/* size of buffer (in bytes) */
	BPVRlib_Play_BlockMode block /* block mode */

/***********************************************************/ /**
Summary:
This function is used to detect when scatter gather buffers have
been completed by the playback hardware since the last call to
BPVRlib_Play_IsBufferComplete().

Description:
After scatter gather buffers have been added to the playback
channel using the BPVRlib_Play_AddBuffer() this function can
be used to determine when they have completed.

For example, if two buffers where added, this function would be
called until both of those buffers were reported complete.

The block parameter can be used to block until one or more buffers
have been completed.
