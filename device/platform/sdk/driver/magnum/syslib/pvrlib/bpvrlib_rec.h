/*================== Module Overview =====================================

This module implements the record functionality for pvr using an intermediate
ring buffer. It features a programmable buffer location, buffer size, and number
of descriptors. It also supports a constant stream by dynamically adding buffers
into the transport record hardware.

The following general overview describes the record algorithm:
  
 1.0 Allocate
 
   - The number of descriptors and buffer address are passed as parameters
   - The ring buffer manager is allocated
   - Array of descriptors is allocated (all descriptors are added to free list)
 
 1.1 Configure Record
 
   - Data transport PIDs are enabled and configured
   - Record parameters are configured (including decryption/encryption, etc)
   - Record pid channel bitmap is enabled
   - SCT record parameters should be set
 
 1.2 Start Record (SCT record channel should be started first if required)
 
   - Ring buffer manager is reset
   - Entire buffer is divided evenly between all descriptors.
	  Descriptors are filled in and added to record hardware and hardware list
   - Record hardware is started
 
 1.3 Get Data (not re-entrant for same record channel)
 
   - Buffer address and size is requested from the ring buffer manager
   (this step may block if there is no data available)
   (blocking is disabled if the record channel is stopped)
   - Data is copied unsigned char specified buffer
   - Ring buffer read offset is updated
   - If current read offset is large enough to accomidate descriptor
	  bfr size, the decriptor is removed from free list and 
	  added back into record hardware and hardware list.
   - The amount of data copied from record channel is returned
   - Overflow status is returned
 
 (Alternate to 1.3)
 1.3.1 Request to Get Data (steps 1.3.x not re-entrant for same record channel)
 
   - Buffer address and size is requested from the ring buffer manager
   (this step may block if there is no space available)
   (blocking is disabled if the record channel is stopped)
   - Overflow status is returned
 
 1.3.2 Data is copied from specified buffer by calling code
 
 1.3.3 Read pointer is updated
   - Ring buffer read offset is updated
   - If current read offset is large enough to accomidate descriptor
	  bfr size, the decriptor is removed from free list and 
	  added back into record hardware and hardware list.
 
 1.4 Check for Hardware Data Complete
 
   - First descriptor is removed from hardware list
   - Event is triggered signaling removal of descriptor
   - Ring buffer write offset is updated
   - Event is triggered signaling addition of data into ring buffer
   - Descriptor is added to free list
   - Check if next descriptor has also completed (repeat process if necessary)
 
 1.5 Stop Record
 
   - Record hardware is stopped
   - Wait for record done interrupt to occur if we are stopping a transport record channel
	  (sct channels are slaved to the transport channel)
	  (Data complete interrupt handler updates read pointer based upon what 
	  data is recorded after stop occurs)
   - All left over descriptors are moved from hw to the free list
   - Any blocking calls are released (future calls are not allowed to block)
   - Additional get data function call should be called to get remaining
	  data from record.
 
 1.6 Free
 
   - Free descriptor buffer
   - Free ring buffer manager

/****************************************************************
Summary:
This function allocates the resources required for a 
record.  

Description:
This includes a ring buffer manager,
descriptor list, etc.  The record ring buffer is evenly
divided between the number of descriptors.  This requires
the size of the buffer to be cleanly divisable (on a 32 bit
boundary) by the number of requested descriptors.
The pvrMemCopyCb parameter only needs to be valid
if the BPVRlib_Rec_GetData() function is going to be
used.
