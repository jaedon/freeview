/**
Nexus' file architecture is extensible through wrappers.
The file module must exist in the same execution space as the application (for example,
even in a kernel mode configuration, the file module runs in the user space proxy)
therefore a non-thunked wrapper is acceptable.

This is an example of a customer wrapper which applies a beginning and ending offset to both stream and index data.
By providing an example, we enable each customer to customize and extend the design.

Underlying the NEXUS_FilePlayHandle is the BSEAV/lib/bfile architecture.
It uses an abstraction scheme to provide inheritance.
