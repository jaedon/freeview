 *
 * Module Description: Example code to demonstrate spectrum data retieval.
 * NEXUS_FrontendSpectrumSettings is used to specify the input parameters for requesting the spectrum data.
 * The memory needs to be allocated such that it is >= numSamples*4 as numSamples is 4byte long each.
 * NUM_SAMPLES can be changed to requested the required number of frequency samples from the FFT output.
 * Then call NEXUS_Frontend_RequestSpectrumData(). Once the requested frequency data is ready for the application to be used,
 * Nexus fires a callback registered in the input parameter dataReadyCallback.
