    This app demonstrates the recommendations in nexus_dma.h regarding RAC page alignment and the RAC.

    3 test scenarios:
    
    "nexus bad_rac_blit 0"
        result: this will fail - don't use RAC aligned surface and don't flush between HW write and CPU read
    "nexus bad_rac_blit 1"
        result: this will pass. uses RAC alignment surfaces.
    "nexus bad_rac_blit 2"
        result: this will pass. flush between HW write and CPU read.

    notes:
    some RAC's are 4K and others are 8K. 2nd param gives option.
    your surface_offset must be >= the L1 cache size, otherwise you are just testing L1 cache coherency. 3rd param gives option.
