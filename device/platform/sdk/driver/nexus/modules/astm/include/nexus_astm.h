Module Overview

This interface allows the system to adapt to bad TSM environments including
bad PCR's, missing PCR's, bad PTS's, etc. ASTM monitors the system and moves
the decoders into and out of TSM mode as needed. The goal is to keep seeing
and hearing the audio and video with the best lispsync possible, even if TSM
is not possible.

The ASTM algorithm can be summarized as follows:

Presentation Control
 - ASTM monitors both audio and video decoders looking for TSM failures.
   - A TSM failure is defined as a certain number of PTS errors. The current
     threshold is 10,but that is programmable.
 - If both decoders are failing, ASTM will try a PTS master mode first.
 - If only one decoder is failing, ASTM will enter directly into non-TSM
   mode.
 - If either decoder is still failing after trying a master mode, it will
   switch to non-TSM mode.

Clock Recovery
 - ASTM monitors the receipt of PCRs looking for high jitter
   - The jitter tolerance threshold and consecutive out-of-tolerance counter
     are programmable.
 - If the incoming clock reference has high jitter, ASTM will decouple the
   timebase from the input clock (and couple it to the internal crystal)
 - If the incoming clock reference returns to low jitter, ASTM will recouple
   the timebase to the input clock

If the application manually puts a decoder into vsync mode, ASTM will not
move it into TSM mode.  The application can also manually set the three
controls ASTM provides:
 - presentation control (PTS or output clock),
 - stc source (PCR or PTS, with which PTS is used being a preference), and
 - clock coupling (input or crystal).
Any manual setting will not be overridden by ASTM.

See nexus/examples/astm.c for an example.
