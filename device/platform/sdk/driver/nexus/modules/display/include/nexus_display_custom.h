NEXUS_VideoFormat_eCustom0 and NEXUS_VideoFormat_eCustom1 are customizable, but only by replacing magnum/commonuntils/fmt/bfmt_custom.c.
They are not customizable at runtime using this function. Only NEXUS_VideoFormat_eCustom2 is customizable using this function.

On set-top boxes, this is used for transcoder display configuration.

The DTV version of this function is different.
