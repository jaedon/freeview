/*=****************************************
This file contains common data structures for VBI input and output.

The VBI data types that are currently supported in Nexus are:
- Closed Captioning
- Teletext
- WSS (Widescreen Signalling)
- CGMS (Copy generation management system - analog)
- VPS (Video Program System)
- GemStar

Other types will be added as needed.

VBI data can be read from VideoInput or written to a Display for output on a VEC.
See nexus_video_input_vbi.h and nexus_display_vbi.h.

See nexus_types.h for NEXUS_ClosedCaptionData.
