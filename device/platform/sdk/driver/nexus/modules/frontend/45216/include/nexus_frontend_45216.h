Summary:
    Settings for a BCM45216 Device

Description:
    This structure provides the settings when opening a 45216 device. (A FrontendDeviceHandle
maps to the frontend chip, a FrontendHandle maps to a specific demod path.)
    In a typical external frontend configuration, the frontend uses an interrupt path to
alert the backend. This will usually be either an external interrupt (specified by
isrNumber), or as a GPIO Interrupt (specified via gpioInterrupt -- the handle is opened
by the caller, not by NEXUS_FrontendDevice_Open45216).
    An external frontend will require a communication path, requiring either i2cDevice and
i2cAddr to be specified, or spiDevice and spiAddr to be specified.  The I2C or SPI handle
needs to be opened by the caller.
    For the 45216, there are additional configuration options for the Diseqc configuration,
allowing an alternate i2cAddr and i2cDevice to be specified specifically for diseqc.  The
pinmux for diseqc configuration may also be specified by setting setPinmux to true and
providing the alternate pinmux values.
    On the 45216, mtsif[0] maps to MTSIF0 TX configuration, and mtsif[1] maps to MTSIF1 TX.
Both mtsif[0].clockRate and mtsif[1].clockRate can be set, and both mtsif[0].driveStrength and
mtsif[1].driveStrength can be set to 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16.  If mtsif[x].enabled is set
to false (it will be set to true by default), the clock of that MTSIFx TX will be turned off,
and if both are disabled (by setting both mtsif[0].enabled and mtsif[1].enabled to false),
the master MTSIF TX clock will be turned off.
