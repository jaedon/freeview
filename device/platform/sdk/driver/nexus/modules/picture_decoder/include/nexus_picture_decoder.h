/*=**************************
The Picture decoder provides a method for decoding a single picture
into memory for use as a graphics surface.

This module performs a different function from the StillDecoder. The Nexus StillDecoder is an extension
of the VideoDecoder. The StillDecoder receives MPEG/AVC/VC1 I-frames from transport and decodes them with the
VideoDecoder hardware. Therefore it is used for PVR still frames. The PictureDecoder is used for non-PVR images.
