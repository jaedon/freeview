Summary:
Handle for packet substition (PSUB) channel returned by NEXUS_PacketSub_Open

Be aware that "packet substition" does not substitute data packets. It inserts
new data packets without replacing old data packets.
By default PSUB inserts those new packets into bandwidth openings created
by dropping NULL packets. So, it is a bandwidth substition, not a data substitution.
If you set forcedOutput=true, then there is no substitution at all, only unconditional insertion.

Get buffer for adding data to be inserted

of the other data feed API's in Nexus (using GetBuffer/ReadComplete).

All data must be added before calling NEXUS_PacketSub_Start. Because of this, the underlying implementation is not
actually a ring buffer.
If you want the data to be fed in a continual loop, set NEXUS_PacketSubSettings.loop = true.
