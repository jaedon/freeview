Summary:
Callback when external interrupt fires.

Description:
The nexus callback architecture requires a task switch to get a callback to an application.
If your latency requirements can allow for this, you can use this callback.
If your latency requirements exceed this, you need to write custom Nexus platform or module code to process the L1 interrupt inside Nexus.
