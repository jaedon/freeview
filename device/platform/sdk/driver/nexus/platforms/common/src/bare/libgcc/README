If a file is in this directory, it is here because the GCC compiler even in freestanding mode,
required the subroutines found in these files to be linked with the output of the
compiler (i.e. a compiled program).

Although some of these files may have GPL license terms, they are granted an exception
to the terms due to fact they are required for runtime support of GCC compiled files. This 
comment is from one such file with regard to GPL.

/* As a special exception, if you link this library with other files,
   some of which are compiled with GCC, to produce an executable,
   this library does not by itself cause the resulting executable
   to be covered by the GNU General Public License.
   This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why
   the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.
 */

If this is not the case, we will make every effort to replace these files
with non-GPL versions.
