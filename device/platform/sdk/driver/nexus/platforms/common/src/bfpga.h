/*================== Module Overview =====================================
This module is used to program the FPGA on the 97038 reference design.

It requires the EBI bus to be configured such that the FPGA's registers
are memory mapped.  Normally, this is done in the boot ROM, but can be
configured as part of the application software using the following.

Sample Code:

#include "bchp_ebi.h"
#include "boardmap.h"
static void BFramework_InitFpga(const BFramework_Info *pFrameworkInfo)
{
	BREG_Write32(pFrameworkInfo->hRegister, BCHP_EBI_CS_BASE_3, CPU_PHYS_FPGA_BASE|BCHP_EBI_CS_BASE_3_size_SIZE_32MB);
	BREG_Write32(pFrameworkInfo->hRegister, BCHP_EBI_CS_CONFIG_3, 
			BCHP_FIELD_DATA(EBI_CS_CONFIG_3, enable, 1) | 
			BCHP_FIELD_DATA(EBI_CS_CONFIG_3, ta_wait, 1) |
#if BSTD_CPU_ENDIAN==BSTD_ENDIAN_LITTLE
			 BCHP_FIELD_DATA(EBI_CS_CONFIG_3, le, 1)
#else
			0
#endif
			);
}
