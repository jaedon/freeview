* PR42421: changed the B_PSIP_GetProgram() api to accept a time range.
*  this allows the caller to request multiple program data.  note that
*  requesting data over long time ranges will require the caller to
*  increase the api timeout value significantly.

* 2   6/26/08 5:29p tokushig
* PR42421: added optimization when searching for program ending earlier
*  than the first program
* 
* 1   6/13/08 6:12p tokushig
* PR42421: split b_psip_lib.c into multiple files, updated comments and
*  headers, removed some dead code
