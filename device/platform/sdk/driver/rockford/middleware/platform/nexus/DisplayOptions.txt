This platform layer contains several different implementations of the display interface.
Each of these can be used when appropriate by changing some environment variables prior to building as detailed below.

exclusive_display_nexus.c
-------------------------
The platform layer is given exclusive ownership of the display. It manages the swapping of framebuffer surfaces onto the display. No external code should do anything with the display.

This mode is the fastest and is useful for full-screen 3D applications and demos. No server application should be used. Only one 3D application can be run at any time.

User-mode environment setup:
unset NEXUS_MODE
unset CLIENT

Kernel-mode environment setup:
export NEXUS_MODE=proxy
unset CLIENT

blit_display_nexus.c
--------------------
The client application has control of the display. The platform layer makes requests via a callback for the application to display a rendered surface when appropriate.

This mode uses more bandwidth than exclusive mode since there is a extra blit step involved. It is useful if you need to composite the 3D results with other rendering steps. Only one 3D application can be run at any time.

Blit display & exclusive display are both available when these build options are set as they use different platform layer APIs.

User-mode environment setup:
unset NEXUS_MODE
unset CLIENT

Kernel-mode environment setup:
export NEXUS_MODE=proxy
unset CLIENT


surface_comp_display_nexus.c
----------------------------
A server application has complete control of the display. The platform layer posts surfaces to the server's surface-compositor. The compositor takes care of positioning the surfaces and displaying them.

This mode is recommended for multi-process environments. You can run multiple 3D applications simultaneously.

You must have a Nexus compositing server running in order to run applications in this mode.

User-mode environment setup:
NEXUS_MODE=client
export CLIENT=y

Kernel-mode environment setup:
export NEXUS_MODE=proxy
export CLIENT=y


null_display_nexus.c
--------------------
No display is used at all. The 3D surfaces are written to PNG files as they are produced.

This is purely a diagnostic mode.

User-mode environment setup:
export NULL_DISPLAY=y
unset NEXUS_MODE
unset CLIENT
