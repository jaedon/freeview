Module   :  Fixed-size non-relocatable block allocator

FILE DESCRIPTION
Used primarily for per-frame allocations:
- control lists, uniforms, shader records and the like (via fmem)
- tessellated vertices for vg
- binning memory
As such, total memory usage depends heavily on the number of frames in the
pipeline. We attempt to limit memory usage by waiting before certain
allocations. We split allocations into two categories: "throttling" (fmems) and
non-throttling (everything else). We have a separate limit for throttling
allocations that is adjusted dynamically: we try to maximise the limit while
avoiding non-throttling allocation waits. If non-throttling allocations are
being forced to wait (or exceed the desired limit, or fail), the limit is
adjusted downwards. Otherwise, if the high water mark is low, the limit is
adjusted upwards. This separate (lower) limit is an attempt to avoid the backend
of the pipeline being choked by allocations occurring in the front of the
pipeline.
