   Invariant:

   Before performing _any_ operation on a GLXX_BUFFER_T, the underlying memory
   block will have had glxx_buffer_term() installed as its terminator



   We have a conceptual boolean variable conceptual_buffers_owned_by_master which
   represents our ability to modify buffer contents from within the master process.
   (It is not necessary in order to modify the buffer object itself or to alter the
   "shared" object by adding/removing buffers).
