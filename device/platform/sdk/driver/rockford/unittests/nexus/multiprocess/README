nexus multiprocess stress tests

for the multiprocess stress tests, there are two apps - a server and a client. for linux kernel mode, they both link
to the same libnexus.so. for linux user mode they link to separate libraries - libnexus.so and libnexus_client.so.
therefore, a two pass build is required.

make client
make server

to run the applications, you use the "stress_server" application with a variety of command line parameters.
the stress_server starts nexus, then launches a variety of processes and clients.
see stress_server.c for more details.

examples include:

# one time run
nexus stress_server
nexus stress_server join_stress_client
nexus stress_server alloc_stress_client

# indefinite run
time while [ 1 ]; do nexus stress_server || break; done
time while [ 1 ]; do nexus stress_server join_stress_client; done
time while [ 1 ]; do nexus stress_server alloc_stress_client; done

# one time run with modified loop params
nexus stress_server join_stress_client 100 10
nexus stress_server alloc_stress_client 25 75
